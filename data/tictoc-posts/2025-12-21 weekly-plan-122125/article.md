# Weekly Plan 12.21.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Dec 21, 2025*

Hey traders- 

During the week we saw lows come in either at or very near my prior weekly levels, at 6780 and 6930 respectively. 

Looking ahead at the week, this is a holiday shortened week. These tend to be bullish looking at recent several months. 

If you are looking at some earth shattering volatility you need to see this market break below 6818 and stay below it for the week. 

We last traded 6890 at time of this post. These are Emini March 26 levels. 

> **Scenario 1:** As long as we hold 6856-6862, we could see support kick in for a move back into 6932.

> **Scenario 2: **My edge case on the week will be 6818 on downside and 6932 on the upside.

Slightly abridged post today, I am working on some key themes for next year, as well as brand new educational content for our folks which I should be posting next week. 

**Some other ideas **

On momentum side, keep an eye out on this CRWV. 

This stock recently had a large move and  I think if we dip but do not break 72-75, I think we are headed back into 110 on Coreweave. It is about 83 now. 

I like January 23 $83 CALLS as short term lotto if had for 3-4 dollars. 

ORCL 

Oracle had a solid move from my support level and closed at 193 on Friday. 

If we continue to hold these recent lows at 160-178, I think we could retrace to 220 to fill some gaps at 220-240 on Oracle.
