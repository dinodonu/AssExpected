# Can Bitcoin decouple from stocks?

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Feb 05, 2026*

Finally, the surge in trading I mentioned a few days ago manifested today in that clean break below 6900 which at time of this post is now taking us down into 6790s. 

The amount of CAPEX done by these companies is simply too hard for this market to digest with no clear path to profitability. 

We have to lean on some of these levels now to discern when some sort of meaningful bottom could be near— for the session ahead or two, I think it will come down to 6840-6850. Important levels now to overcome. Else could be resistance. 

What you do not see yet is that there has been significant carnage in these stocks like PLTR, MSFT, SOFI, AMD which is not yet evident in the indices. 

Now, would I say something like PLTR or SOFI , even a HOOD is at decent prices? Look at NFLX, trading fairly decently fair prices I think. 

While these are all at fair prices in my view, that would be meaningless without support from the main indices. So the general market has to firm up before these stocks can find some reprieve here, even though I believe them to be trading at decent supports. 

Now, one thought I amongst others have is that the Trump admin has to step in and do something about this selling, if they are serious about the mid terms. 

The White House is run by a very able administrate in Susie Wills and I think they are having these conversations — political agenda without support of the people is dead weight. They need to win the popular support back and this would mean setting aside more radical elements in the apparatus and embracing more middle of the road, common sense , it is the economy approach. Fast. 

This could on paper help these stocks —but how much can be done, without causing a spike in inflation? These are questions we do not know an answer to.  I personally do not see any reprieve for these stocks now, given everything else, unless drastic fiscal and monetary support kicks in. 

While some of these stocks have been selling off and primarily they have been selling off due to immense CAPEX spending that the market thinks will not bring any payoffs for these companies, Bitcoin itself is trading as highly correlated to software stocks. 

I think this correlation needs to break at some point as Bitcoin really doesn’t need to do any Capex on anything. I personally think 37K is a vital line in sand for Bitcoin for a move back into 80-92k. I believe 47 and 62K also remain formidable support levels on Bitcoin.
