# Daily Plan 12.16.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Dec 16, 2025*

Hey folks- 

So in the cash session today once again you can see the nature of these prices derived from orderflow, pure PA and market internals, we had the exact low and high of the session shared yesterday— to the tick. 

For the session tomorrow, the HVN low of this range from last couple of days is in play. 

On the downside, you are about 40 points or so from critical support levels. 

Below are a couple of price action scenarios— 

> Scenario 1: I will like to see intraday support come in at 6818-6820 for a move back into the HVN low near 6865.

> Scenario 2: If we are going to retake the HVN low at 6860 and remain bid above 6860 I will like to see 6900 retested.

As we progress thru the week, remember these prices at 6780-6818 are very important. Ideally the bulls want to see a sharp rejection here to close above 6865. As a bull you do not want to see consolidation here at 6818 and in my view you certainly do not want to see price acceptance below 6818. 

Technically this is a weak market and is not supported by larger mega caps, despite impressive actions in the likes of TSLA. The main thing going for this market at the moment is the seasonality. You have strong seasonality in play here next 2 weeks or so. This is why I am hesitant yet to call all clear for the bears, especially if 6780-6818 range continues to hold. 

At time of this post, we last traded 6840. These are Emini March levels, for SPX levels subtract about 60 from these.
