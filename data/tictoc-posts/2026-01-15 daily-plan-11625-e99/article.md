# Daily Plan 1.16.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 15, 2026*

Hey- 

Pursuant to chat this AM, the dip today was shallow and was bought in end of the day for a meagre rally. 

The challenge here for any one bearish is that the dips are very shallow. Then related markets like IWM are breaking out. If you recall, I recently shared IWM at 240, it closed at 266 today. 

I think hard to be bearish here unless below 6963-6970. 

I think if we continue to hold these lows today, we could wanna breakout too and test 7050. We will see if we wanna be bearish below 6970. Stay tuned. Join the chat. It’s for you. 

Other markets 

I am liking this action in Adobe  

The stock has cratered 26% this year. 

I think if we hold 240, this could be around a 400-450 dollar stock. It is 300 at the moment. 

The company makes 7 billion in profit, which is two billions more than TSLA (purely as a thought exercise). The stock sells at a valuation of 90% less than that of TSLA. 

These September 400 dollar calls, I think may be a bit expensive at 12, but if you wanna mark it down somewhere, if it were 7-8 dollars, I think they will appear nice from risk to reward.
