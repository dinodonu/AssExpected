# Daily Plan 10.8.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Oct 08, 2025*

Hey folks- 

From the weekly 6800 resistance, we have seen 3 failed attempts this week since Sunday night open to take out 6750 on the downside, each one failing. 

If you recall , from the weekly plan, we now have had 2 sessions of solid balancing activity above 6750 which could indicate potential support forming here. 

> **Scenario 1:** We could leverage this support for the session tomorrow and as long as we hold the lows from today near 6743-6750 or so, I think we are going to make another swipe at 6800.

> **Scenario 2:** I will also keep an eye out on this 6761-6763 area for the cash session. If we open AND remain above, this could provide support to push higher into 6800.

**TLRY**

For November, I will keep an eye out on TLRY $1 CALL. This is a 80 cent call right now, but I think IF had for 30-50 cents , in my view I expect this call to be up 20% to 100% +.
