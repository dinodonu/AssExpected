# Daily Plan 1.6.26

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 06, 2026*

Hey traders- 

We are seeing some level of hesitation at the 6950 level to further advance, but a deeper reaction here has not materialized. 

I think we are waiting on the Econ data later in the week with the services PMI as well as the Non farm payrolls to make a decisive break. 

In meantime, we could see more balancing here. 

On the session, 6890-6903 if we trade down into it, could remain supported. 

> Scenario 1: 6890-6903 could be potential support if tested for move back into 6940-6950.

> Scenario 2: Overnight lows here around 6930 could also remain key in the session today. I think if we need to see 6903 trade, we will need to break 6930 within the first hour or two.
