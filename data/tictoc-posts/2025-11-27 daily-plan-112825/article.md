# Daily Plan 11.28.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 27, 2025*

Good day traders, and a very happy Thanksgiving to those of you who celebrate, 

As they say in real estate, it is all about location, location, location! I say in short term trading it is all about liquidity, liquidity, liquidity! 

Orderflow gives us an opportunity to find out where liquidity may be residing. And this is why often times, we have exact lows and highs on our hands. 

The beauty of this system is if we are going to be wrong, we are going to find out rather quickly and do not need to sit thru monster drawdowns or decipher tea leaves of wedges and head and shoulders and triangles and what not! 

1. So for the session tomorrow, know that it is only half a session with close at 1215 PM. We could expect a continuation of Wednesday auction into 6850.
2. On the downside, if we are going to have a continuation into 6850s, I will say we need to hold 6790 or so.
3. Keep an eye out on this 6815-6820 area as well. This could be a quick scalp level if this range holds.

GME

Keep an eye out on this GME. If you are a regular reader you know I have a bullish bias on this for many months now, since low 20s. If this pumps into 22-23, but then pulls back into 22, these December 26, $23 calls if had for 1-2 dollars could make sense for a lotto.
