# Daily Plan 1.9.26

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 09, 2026*

Folks— 

Not a super formal plan today due to major pending news. The SCOTUS decision should be out before noon tomorrow and then you have the non farm payrolls. 

Regardless of which way this goes, this could create some uncertainty for the markets. While the trend remains up, there could be large volatility in the session. 

We saw that the support today at 6940 held remarkably well. However the bounce was rather shallow. 

On top of that you are seeing a rally in value type names and I think NVDA wants to trade lower. 

Generally speaking, if we are trading down into 6850 and it holds, I favor support here for push higher unto 6892. 

**As an intermediate level of interest, 6930-6940 is still important**. This level at 6930 has been tested in night yesterday but we could not quite trade it in the cash session, missing it by 4 points. If we test it, and then close above 6950 on the daily tomorrow, this is a good sign. On the flip side, if we test it, break it, and then stay below it, this is probably going to open doors to more volatility ahead. 

If there is a set up in the cash session once the dust settles I will share in the chat below. Stay tuned. 

Remember these levels are based on current available data. It could change any time and we will have to reconfigure— everything we do is a function of order flow. Now with these levels we have tried to bake most of known info but there is always a room for something new that appears which was not “baked in”. 

In particular, we need to stay on top of this NVDA situation. If we dip into 170, we could take SPY down with it. NVDA has almost no sales from China at the moment, but this market is skittish about the whole China question, adding pressure on the chip maker.
