# Daily Plan 8.5.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 04, 2025*

So we see a 130 dollars pop from that Weekly and Friday support near 6220 to end the session today near 6370. 

For days ahead, I think this 6380/6330 area remains key. 

I do think minus any material catalysts in week ahead, we could see range bound action here and if we are unable to close back above 6380 soon, we could revisit last week’s lows at some point. 

We could see some rocky month or two ahead and I think we can see some abatement towards start of Fall. 

My key level tomorrow will be 6392. 

> Scenario 1: if we remain below 6392, we could retest 6330.

> Scenario 2: My edge case on the session will be above 6392 or below 6330. We are now 6370.

In some related markets we saw one of the best quarters by any public company ever by PLTR today. You will recall I was bullish on this at 150 just a few days ago, and at time of this post, it traded as high above 170 today post market. 

Then we saw an amazing day in comm scope. It was up almost a 100% today, this was shared by me only few days ago at 7.
