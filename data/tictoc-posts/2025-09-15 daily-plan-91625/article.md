# Daily Plan 9.16.25 

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 15, 2025*

Look all around folks — there are winners every single direction you look. 

Not a single orderflow not blessed  by the bull market gods! Frankly too many to list them all here. 

On the emini side the hysteria is very strong. The market is front running this FED easing. We need to see some signaling on the tape that we can have some meaningful sell off. 

Until then, I think behooves to just stay with the trend. When bear market begins it is likely we could miss out on the top 10-12% of the move down but that is worth the confirmation. But a lot of opportunities will be born and we will have tremendous number of puts but that day alas is not today. 

For the session tomorrow, on the emini December contract, lows around 6640 could come in support if tested. I will also add that if we open and remain above **6674**, then we could push higher into **6692**. 

In other news, from that post last night we saw TSLA trade into 430 almost overnight from that 390 Friday close. Presumably due to Musk spending some billion dollars  on buying stocks at an average price of 389. 

Many folks construed this to mean Musk has some advanced intel on major turnaround in fortunes for TSLA so he must be buying stock. 

I kind of disagree here. I think this was a reactive move on his part, I mean for a man who is almost worth half a trillion dollars, what difference does a billion dollars make? Back it up by throwing atleast 5-10 billion dollars at it and then we are talking. 

My point is that the Daily auction on TSLA looks extremely interesting and if you are a regular reader you know all about my call on TSLA when it was 290 back when. 

I will not chase it here at 430. 

In fact I think if it pops higher again into 420s, 430s, these June 2026 $200 PUTS if had for 3-5 dollars, as pure lotto are appealing to me personally. These are pure lottos not based on any technical signal but lotto.
