# Powell or Trump? Who to follow?

*Daily Plan 9.24.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 24, 2025*

Powell today when asked about his stance on FED setting its policy and its impact on financial markets today minced no words in saying "this market is fairly highly valued”. This is bureaucrat speak for “over valued”. 

**Who will you trust more here? **

The world’s most powerful central banker or a President who wants to pump stocks at all cost? 

**My take:** this is a well informed career economist on top of his game, whose views I shall not take lightly. I think we will see a nice bout of volatility in days and weeks ahead but I have presented a price action framework below which could help inform my decisions in days ahead. 

Haters will say I was wrong if we smash into 7000s from here (*while conveniently forgetting the unforgettable rally in dozens of stocks shared here in last 12 weeks*), but I am presenting an analytical orderflow based perspective below which I think could unfold over next few sessions. If it does not play out this way, we still get a solid confirmation of strength of this uptrend. 

Technically, there is no indicator that we have a bearish reversal here,  however as these things go, I will be super wary of risk here, unless we begin closing above 6742-6750 here again now. 

On the tape, we might have seen some weakness here which needs to be further validated by next couple of sessions. What happens here between 6709 and 6742-6750 is important. 

If we lean on some of these levels from today at 6740-6750, I will like to see this market find resistance here in sessions ahead. 

On the downside, 6700 remains fairly important. I think there is weakness on the tape which may not manifest immediately, and certainly we can rule that out if we manage to close back above 6740. 

However, if we see a session or two ahead remain balanced between 6700 and 6742, this begs the question, **can we have this market explore lows from prior week near 6610**? And I think the answer is Yes. 

**So to summarize: **

1. For the session tomorrow and possibly into end of the week, 6742-6750 may come in as resistance.
2. 6700 while an orderflow support, if broken could lead us lower into 6663-6666.
3. At any rate, any balance that happens here between 6700 and 6750, which then breaks to the downside under 6700, OR, any failed breakout above 6750 that then closes below 6750, in my view, is a bearish occurrence and should bring a good sized sell off. Please re-read the if statements in these as they are important price action framework.

The ball is in now bulls’ court. They need to demonstrate this weakness on the tape is either transitory or something that is portend to manifest itself as “lower highs and lower lows” in days ahead. A close or two above 6742 may put these worries at bay. 

Minus that, I will like some of the lower levels from last week near 6660 tested. 

We last traded 6720 at time of this post. These are emini December levels. Please adjust for SPX and SPY for anyone trading those markets.
