# TACO Again.  

*Daily plan 1.22.26*
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 22, 2026*

So what you saw today is a classic case of knowing your support and resistances, and letting the market come to you. 

We did see the exact low today at the support from yesterday’s email. The rally here was a torrid one— some non stop action there after Trump announced he has “a framework of deal with Greenland” and rolled back the proposed tariffs on the 8 European nations. 

At surface, this may look like negotiations or even a classic case of TACO but the reality is that at a deeper level it shows complete and total incapability to deal with any sell off in markets at all. They are selling this as some sort of genius deal, but I think they chickened out due to that sell off Sunday night. 

I don’t know what it is about these markets the powers that be are so motivated to protect at any and all cost! 

The thing with volatility is that  you can push it out, you can postpone it but it accrues over time. This energy builds up which will only lead to a much harder crash later when these people lose their control over these markets. But for now, it appears the market liked this truce. 

For the session tomorrow, I still think we see** 6880-6890 **remain important levels. 

I think if we hold these levels, we could head higher into 6980, may be swipe at** 7000 **one more time before finding resistance there. 

This bullish thesis is invalidated if we close below **6880** tomorrow.
