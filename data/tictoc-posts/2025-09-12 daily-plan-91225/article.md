# Daily Plan 9.12.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 12, 2025*

GM Trader- 

So as you can see from the yesterday AM chat, this market at the moment is in a “Buy the dip” mania phase. These dips have been shallower and shallower— At some point these lower orderflow support prices will get retested, this is just the nature of the emini market, however predicting when is anyone’s guess. 

We could perhaps lean in the SOC (Scene of Crime) level of CPI yesterday at **6540-6552 **as potentially important level for today. 

Unless we were to offer below this range, and stay there, this level could provide some level of support to this market, if offered. 

Underneath 6540, I will say, **6517-6522** could remain important for next session or two. If anyone is angling for a deeper sell off here, we must need to overcome this whole area here at **6507 **which is a key level from last Sunday’s plan. 

**AAPL**

So with regards to AAPL, I do like short term options on this may be going out into November and December expiry (monthly). 

For instance, these 245 AAPL CALLS are now 4 dollars. If we do end up trading S&P500 EMini into 6450s, I prefer these calls if they are **had around 2 dollars**.
