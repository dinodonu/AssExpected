# Daily Plan 10.16.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Oct 16, 2025*

Hey folks- 

Let us kick off the post with a couple of observations or rather notes shared in an educational sense. 

**First off, you do not have to trade every day.** As a retail, or even a professional trader, you only want to trade what you understand.  And one of the ways many professionals seek to understand market action is thru volatility. This freedom to not trade itself is a huge edge for us. 

Now you may ask why I said so.. it is because any trading methodology will be a function of volatility not the other way around. Even when you use a very traditional technical methodology  like MACD or RSI or Bollinger bands to name a few, they are all reliant on market volatility. Look when daily average true range aka ATR increases above a certain threshold, a lot of market making algos will either pull their bids and offers, or stop trading altogether. This phenomenon alone is circular meaning it feeds itself. More volatility causes lesser liquidity and lesser liquidity causes even more volatility. 

In plain terms, I am saying what worked just a few days ago, which is to say taking on large size on small moves, may not work now as the market just had a 300 point move 3 days ago which is extremely rare. Very rare. 

The 2nd concept to understand here is that anyone who knows anyone in the US at the moment is plugged into insider info flows. This creates a very skewed market. So for instance, we had a 140 point day on Tuesday and at the time of this post, overnight we have had a 19 dollar range all night! This indicates certain level of insider trading amongst traders who move size. 

This is highly unusual and from our perspectives this means we should only trade what we understand. Let them should their hands first rather than chase. 

This is mostly applicable for shorter term, intraday time frames, not so much for longer term position and investing time frames. 

Hope these 2 takeaways were clear enough. I tried lol! 

**Anyways, so back to some context and levels.. **

As I said we have extreme volatility at the moment. This is not obviously Liberation Day stuff but still not for faint of the heart. The problem for bulls has been volatility which is carving out these ginormous ranges, but for the bears, the issue is this market refusing to find any takers below 6600! There seems to be buyers at this 6600-6610 zone. 

This is the Sunday night gap fill zone which I posted on Monday and after we filled this gap, we found very few takers here on the bearish side. This zone has to be taken out in my view if we are to raid further into 6400 area and remains probably key in intraday time frames, if tested. 

In intraday time frames, I will say even this 6677-6680 probably remains key and could be important today and tomorrow. 

> Scenario 1: 6677 if tested could be supported for a retest of overnight highs near 6722 or so.

> Scenario 2: If we are able to break 6677 and remain below it, we could try and see what is there at 6640 or so.
