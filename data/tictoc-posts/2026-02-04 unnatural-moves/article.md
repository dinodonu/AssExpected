# Unnatural moves. 

*Daily Plan 2.4.26*
*Tic Toc Trading — Feb 04, 2026*

So volume is picking up even though the directional clarity is lacking.

In mega caps and tech side of the house,  as well there are very few bright spots — AAPL, SNDK, , PLTR and Google. All orrderflow stocks. 

I would say reading and making sense of this action is a tough call but for what it is worth you have the volume picking up here right under 7000 and I am confident whatever comes out of this will be a large 10-15% move. 

If you are in the bullish camp, it is not a bad idea to let this thing break out of here above recent highs near 7000-7050. For anyone leaning bearish, this is a good spot in my view as well, as your risk here can be fairly well defined. If we start closing above these recent highs, any bearish thesis will be voided. 

However this surge in trading activity here is very suspect — this is not your typical day traders causing these moves so definitely this portends a very large move in days and weeks ahead. 

In intraday time frames, I think these moves are here to stay until and unless we break out of this range. For the session tomorrow, we can lean on this 6911 or so level as potential important level. 

If this market remains supported, this level needs to kick in and provide relief to the bulls for a move back into 6950. 

On the upside, 6992-7000 could come in as intraday  resistance.
