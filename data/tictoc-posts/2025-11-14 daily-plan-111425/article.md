# Daily Plan 11.14.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 14, 2025*

Hey traders- 

We are finding overhead supply at 6900 orderflow level. The bulls need to clear this if we are going to break out of this rut. 

At this moment we are again selling down into 6720s which is a well traded orderflow level of late. 

I will lean on this 6714-6720 level today as potential support to push into 6763. 

If we are able to find selling activity below 6714, next support could come in at 6692. 

If you are bear you need to see us break below 6692 and stay there, else these levels may be supported for another push into 6821. 

To summarize: focus should shift to 6692-6700 soon. If you are expecting more softness here, you need to see us take out 6692 and stay below. We last traded around 6720.
