# Daily Plan 8.28.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 27, 2025*

So, MSFT looks little tired here, Musk is gone back to posting cultural hero  tweets again, September is more than 60% likely to be a rough month and then on top of that NVDA is building up inventories despite raking in record profits and sales. 

Yet this market refuses to budge. 

On the emini side if you noticed when we liquidated immediately after NVDA ER, we dipped into the support level from today at 6460 and then rallied back above 6482. Such is nature of these levels. 

This level remains in play tomorrow. I think if this market is now going to take the NVDA ER seriously, it will need to do some business below 6460, ideally towards 6422 or so. 

If we remain bid here above 6460, finding support at 6460, we could try another swipe at 6500. 

On the NVDA side itself, if this gap holds let us say we dip into 171-172 on the stock, these 9/5 weekly $180 calls if had for 1.5 to 2 dollars could be a lotto. At any rate if we begin losing 168 on NVDA, we could see some more softness ahead. So 168 is sacrosanct. It is 175 at the moment. 

MYR Group (MYRG)

So this small stock has sold off quite aggressively in last few weeks. I am liking this if it were to hold support near 150-160, I think this could retrace to 220. 

A break of 220 could target 250 dollars. This is 185 and change at the moment.
