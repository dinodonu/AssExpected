# Trading Education. 

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 25, 2026*

Traders— 

The internet is full of bad trading education where focus is on secondary, second hand derivatives of prices action — past sense indicators, short term charts, oscillators which frankly offer little edge. 

Many of you know that I do not use any charts or traditional technical analysis in my trading.

So what do I use? Well I am about to share the secret sauce.

These are extremely important foundational posts which you do not wanna miss.

99% of my work in intraday trading is based on level 2 tape reading, related markets, momentum. 

This is good downtime over the weekend to brush up on education and get smarter about auction theory.

For someone brand new to OrderFlow, I recommend you start from the top and work your way through this post. Many of these posts are FREE to all and I encourage you to share with other traders like yourself to spread the tape’s message! Even for seasoned pros, it does not hurt to review every now and then.

**BASICS:**

Profile concept is very important and can help visualize momentum. These posts are foundational and I will add any more down the road here in this section.

**Intraday momentum:**

You do not want to work against the intraday momentum and this is a good indicator to measure that!

**Level 2 + some examples:**

[Intro to DOM (tape)](https://substack.com/redirect/73cdc8c2-764a-40f9-b6f5-cd4f92a5cdf0?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g): 1st steps towards mastering tape reading.

[A sample of execution ](https://substack.com/redirect/3972a7da-1009-4bcd-a98d-c0981fc4a944?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g): tried to answer few questions on how to leverage the levels.

**Market internals:**

You do not want to ignore what the key market internals are doing at any given time. I think with profile , level 2 and internals, this combo can represent formidable edge.

**Longer term momentum:**

Most of what I do is momentum. Here are a couple of posts on longer term momentum, outside of day to day action:

[How I measure and Trade Momentum](https://substack.com/redirect/42b689f3-85ac-465a-8922-101cddd55c13?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g)

[New Momentum TOOL](https://substack.com/redirect/82564f71-ae28-4aed-9ef8-610192585a46?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g)

**Some thoughts on stops and finding plays on longer term:**

[How I set LIS on longer term swings](https://substack.com/redirect/51668e9b-662b-4e8a-b03b-43df0a984ea4?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g)

[How I use Screeners](https://substack.com/redirect/b613319f-a3c1-4db8-9a3b-0d51995be725?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g)

[Option Metrics and pricing](https://substack.com/redirect/51ab7526-1b49-41f3-83b5-76ccbf7cf8ea?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g)

**Last but not the least**, even if I am down, if I am in good state of mind, I can recoup some of that. With negative mindset, not so much!

[Importance of mindset](https://substack.com/redirect/194168d8-0f27-4857-b3a7-c0bbb55db352?j=eyJ1IjoidWtxd2cifQ.-yPrWVjyxKv3GD1eYZqLCelOXfqZvipiGJXuw8JXd5g)

Stay tuned for much more !
