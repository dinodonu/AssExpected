# Daily Plan 10.2.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Oct 01, 2025*

Hey folks- 

So pursuant to the weekly plan, we came within 20 dollars of that weekly support level and saw a trend day today, carving out a low exactly at 6680 and then rallying some 80 points higher into 6762. 

This was egged on by the likes of NVDA which I shared as a bullish play just on Sunday night. 

See below.

These calls are now in excess of 7 bucks and NVDA looks primed for a break higher here at 187. 

In related space, look at these Micron (Mew) calls. They are pushing past 46 dollars. These were 3 dollars only a couple months ago!

So on the emini side, despite the shutdown and all, as alluded to in the weekly, this has been well received by the markets. It likes it. 

We could say may be 6740 is key tomorrow. We are now trading 6759, I would say if we hold 6740, we are now headed higher into 6800. I would not fade this unless we went below 6740 on the intraday time frame. 

These are emini levels. So SPX is 6740 minus about 60 handles.
