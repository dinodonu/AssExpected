# Daily Plan 9.3.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 03, 2025*

Folks- 

With a flurry of bad overnight news from the overnight repo markets, global markets selling off and bond yields spiking on fears of US tariff uncertainty, we managed to sell down from a high of about 6500 on Monday night to trade down about a 10 or so points from my weekly support zone. 

We ended the day impressively higher, in part due to the alleviation of President Trump health fears, as well as some life getting infused into Google after anti trust judges ruling in its favor. 

GOOG, if you remember is a remarkable stock yours truly shared only few days ago sub 200 and it traded into 230 at time of this pots. 

How about that ULTA? A tremendous winner from when we shared only few weeks ago at 300s. 

For the session tomorrow, the bulls need to recover ground above 6460. 

> **Scenario 1:** As long as we hold 6460 as resistance, we could want to retest 6392-6403.

> **Scenario 2: **If we are able to hold 6392-6403 thru rest of the week, we could retrace back to 6500s.

6392 remains paramountly important. If we begin to close and remain below it, we could target 6250s.
