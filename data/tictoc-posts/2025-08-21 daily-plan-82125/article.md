# Daily Plan 8.21.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 21, 2025*

Today was an excellent example that proves my maxim that you do not need to predict the market to make use of it. 

If you recall, I shared the PLTR support level last night. At the open today, it was trading there. Not only that, in my chatroom below I shared a short term PLTR call at 2 dollars. 

It briefly dipped below 2 into $1.75 before staging a monster rally, clearing $3 in next couple of hours. Not only that we saw a 10% rally in PLTR, a fairly large intraday reversal. 

Install the chat room, when the market gets moving we do not have flexibility of sending an email as it gets lost in transition, chat room is the best way to get most time sensitive updates when opportunity permits. 

Below I have included another example of long term mindset, in this instance a niche farm company called Vital farms. This took almost 9 months to get here, but finally we did it. It closed near 50 today.

On the emini side, we found buyers at weekly support zone. We saw a handsome rally from these levels. What we need to see is this market clear 6460 for a push higher back above 6500. 

On the downside, the weekly level could still remain in play. 

> Scenario 1: 6380 or so remains key level to be broken by bears for a raid into 6250. Minus that we could see this supported.

Bottomline, we need a resolution either with a close below 6380 or above 6460.
