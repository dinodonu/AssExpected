# Rally time. For now. 

*Daily plan 10.21.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Oct 20, 2025*

Hey- 

So we see a nice rally into weekly resistance and the market stalled at these levels. 

At the same time we saw a pretty major dip in the VOL. 

For the session tomorrow, we can lean on 6756-6760. 

If this holds, we can push higher in 6812 or so. These are emini levels. 

**BYND**

Short term November 21 CALLS for 1 strike look nice if 30-50 cents hold. This is a 70 cent call at the moment. 

**SLV**

Weird action in Silver. New high in Gold but not in Silver. 

These lottos for December 19th, if 1.5-2 dollars hold as support on $46.5 PUT look nice. The PUT right now is $2.5.
