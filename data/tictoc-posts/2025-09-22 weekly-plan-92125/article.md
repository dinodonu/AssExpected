# Weekly Plan 9.21.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 22, 2025*

Hey traders- 

So from the weekly plan last Sunday, our main expectation was to see any dips into 6600 supported for a move higher into 6742. 

We came within an inch of this target, and also our low of the week was very close to that 6600 support. These are emini December levels as the roll is completed. 

In some other markets, pursuant to what I have been saying for several weeks now, and others on the Street are catching on, this action is a ditto copy of 2021. 

This is in overall scheme of things not sustainable but some stocks will emerge out of this which will relatively outperform. 

I mean pick any order flow name shared by me here in last few weeks alone, pick any option shared here in the Substack in last 2-3 months- PLTR, AAPL, Quantum stocks, GOOGLE, OKLO, SOFI, TSLA, Gold, Unity— with the exception of DJT , these all have been insane runners for our readers. This is but a sample of few names out of dozens upon dozens of winners. 

Now the flip side of this of course is a lot of these names have run 100%, 200%, some have run up a 1000% or more. A lot of our readers could be newer, many may not have paid attention to these stocks for instance when RGTI was 6 dollars or AAPL was at 190, now to be 100% fair, what do you now if you did not do anything 2-3, 4 months ago ? 

In my opinion, a disciplined approach is a must. I do think these stocks are now at quite a bit of premium to what they were just 2 months ago. This does not mean they will automagically start crashing, but I think better, cheaper setups could be had later in the year or early on in the 2026 start of the year. 

Personally if I did not do anything for any of these names just 8-9 weeks ago, I will not be comfortable chasing them here. 

Now for what it is worth, the S&P500 index is in a breakout mode. Even a 3-5% sell off in the main index, can make these attractive, atleast from a swing time frame. 

What **does that need to look like? **

S&P500 Emini, which is trading almost 6730 at time of this post, dips into 6500-6550. I think that is a robust area for finding decent swing time frame support in many of these related market names. 

Conversely, if you are in the bearish camp and are expecting meaningful sell off, I think it behooves to say that unless we see a weekly time frame close below 6550, you may not get one. 

With this out of the way, I will say 6550 on the emini could be a solid support if tested, for a move back up into 6700. 

There is really not much else to write home about this week, and this could persist for next few more days to weeks but rest assured, I have seen this movie before. Even a small dip in the general market can OPEN many doors for us, we are hitherto locked. 

One thing I will ask though is that regardless of market conditions and volatility, stay plugged in. Often times we tune out when the markets are in a lull or dont appear attractive, but even in such conditions, these markets offer super valuable clues like which stocks are unchanged or even up on down days, or which stocks are down even on up days. These are extremely valuable price action clues which you will miss out on unless you are actively deeper diving into the market action, atleast once a day. 

As and when setups present themselves, I will be sharing orderflow based support levels on each one of these stocks here in the Stack. However, when you look at names like BABA. May be this sells down to 144-150, but this is a company that makes $2 billion in profit every month, and sells at nearly at one fourth the valuation of TSLA. These tend to be value type names and can withstand general market vagaries a bit better.
