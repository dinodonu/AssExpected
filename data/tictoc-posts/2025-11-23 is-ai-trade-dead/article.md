# Is AI Trade Dead?

*Weekly Plan 11.23.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 23, 2025*

Hey traders- 

A very happy Thanksgiving and holiday shortened week! Let us look at some of the themes that may be driving the flows in the near and long term. 

Of late, a lot of attention has been on the crypto sell off, and in particular around some of the stocks in crypto space like MSTR. 

Bitcoin itself has shed around a third of its value, down about 46 grand in as many days from its recent highs. Now trading in the 80Ks, this begs the question— can this continue to spiral down here or is there help on its way? 

Well let us deconstruct this using some price levels to make sense of which levels may be more enduring support levels for longer term buy and holds, not necessarily day traders. 

If you recall my last couple of weekly posts, you will know I touched upon the drying up liquidity in the system and the REPO markets under stress only a couple of weeks ago. 

On top of that, in my last weekly post, when MSTR was trading $200, I called for further softness in MSTR and this week we did sell down into 160s to close the week slight above 165. 

I think there is a large seller in the market and the seller is forced to sell rather than out of choice. Now I also think most of Bitcoin’s current woes are due to the way MSTR altered this whole ecosystem. This is obviously not the only reason, but could be **the** reason. Saylor of Strategy’s main game in recent years since he “discovered” Bitcoin in 2020s, has been to sell stock and convertible debt to buy more Bitcoin. Often times these purchases have been on top end of the trading range. 

Not much thought is paid to where these purchases are made and as a result the average price sits a little bit higher for anyone’s confidence who has to pay millions if not billions in interest for these convertibles as well as anyone who is leveraged to the teeth. 

I think this “bitcoin yield” game is over and what I mean by that is that I think even if Saylor is not selling right now, in near term he is going to be neutered enough to not buy any more! 

This is because at Friday’s close MSTR is now trading slightly below the Net Asset Value (NAV) of Bitcoins it holds. In other words its market cap is in line with the value of assets it holds. Just a couple months ago that was not the case. 

As a matter of fact, at one point a few months ago, MSTR was selling at a 50% premium to its assets. In other words, its market cap was $1.5 for every dollar of Bitcoin it held. Strategy has no other viable business. I do not consider any profits from its other software business in this valuation model.  

This premium is not there anymore. It is gone. And furthermore, I think it is not coming back. In fact I called this premium to go to 0 only a few months ago when MSTR was trading at $400! 

Come to think of it, why would you buy a “Bitcoin treasury holding” company like MSTR, when you can yourself buy Bitcoin and hold it yourself? Isn’t this the whole spiel of Bitcoin? You can store it as a “Store of Value” yourself? And on top of that he now has these copy cats everywhere which jumped on the business model and launched their own “treasury holding” companies, our President included! 

**It was fun while it lasted. **

These 40-50% premiums over NAV allowed Saylor to issue convertible debt as well as issue new stock to buy even more Bitcoin. Now if you are a debt holder, you do not want to convert it into MSTR stocks, you want your principal back, and Saylor still has to pay interest on this debt, and to make matters a little hairy, as price keeps dipping, he cannot buy more. 

Does this mean he at some point will have to start selling? May be. I don’t know, but I think a lot of assumptions about Bitcoin that were fabricated in last year or so have been laid bare as useless. For instance, the experts all said Bitcoin volatility will now subside because it is an institutional asset now. They said gone are the days of 30-50% swings in Bitcoin, and they all said it will behave like a mature asset, like SPY, with slightly higher returns and slightly lower risk than stocks. 

**Well, apparently the market gods had other plans. **

Now remember this 35% sell off in Bitcoin has come at a time when S&P500 is barely down 5% from its highs! What is S&P500 continues to dip? What if we have a 20% dip in S&P500?

So in my view, atleast for next 2-5 years, while Bitcoin is not going anywhere, Saylor is a liability for the whole asset class. So on paper, this guy has an average price of about 75K per Bitcoin, he owns approximately  3-4% of all available supply. So it is not out of realm of possible, if he is forced to liquidate, you are looking at a tsunami of 50-60 billion dollars of forced selling, if the push comes to a shove. A perfect storm of sorts. 

Now while a lot can go wrong for Saylor in next few months, a lot can go right too. 

May be inflation drops to 2%. May be FED brings rates down to almost 0%. May be the FED starts printing trillions more. These are all maybes. Based on current macro, I will let you decide how likely are any of these scenarios to happen in next few months to a year and build your own case if Bitcoin has seen worst of the sell off. I am a little bit on the fence about it. 

I think if Saylor is going to get liquidated, this event will probably happen as Bitcoin nears 60K. And the forced selling alone could send bitcoin down to 50K. Mind you, these are all long term calls, unlikely to play out in next few days to weeks, but I personally feel if Bitcoin were to begin trading lows 50Ks, even a 58-60K, I think it provides a compelling 2+ year time frame support levels. Furthermore, in terms of timing, I think significant lows can be had in Bitcoin if current bout of crypto volatility continues into 2026, I think by Fall of 2026, we are likely looking at a good bottom in Bitcoin for a surge later back into 100-125K, and any prints into 30-50K range in my personal opinion are going to be great support levels for that kind of time frame. 

Now of-course in the short term you could continue to see a short term dead cat bounce. May be we go as high as 95-98K before selling resumes. These things are hard to model in short term but I think the long term trend remains clear. 

AI bubble has also been the talk of the town, especially after Sarah Friar, and Sam Altman both of OpenAI recently floated the possibility of US government backstopping commercial loans required for data center operations. The impetus for such a wild suggestion stemmed from the cost structure required for operationalizing these data centers. 

Main rationale provided by Friar was that the GPU component alone for such data centers is around 70% of total cost. Banks have been unwilling to lend for GPUs as no one really knows how to predict the value of used GPUs. As GPU tech evolves, the existing GPUs could be rendered obsolete in just a few years, making these loans unviable for the lenders. As banks step back to lend for GPUs, this is what has prompted the likes of NVDA to start investing trillions of its own dollars in companies like CoreWeave, in other words the GPU seller is lending cash to potential buyers, interest free, to buy its own GPUs. 

Now in my view, this is a problem that is unlikely to go away anytime soon. In fact I think it is set to worsen as other companies catch on. This has major implications for companies such as META, MSFT, and NVDA who are very invested in this whole ecosystem, but is probably a boon for the likes of GOOG and AAPL which are to a degree far less impacted. My personal view is that even if AI is in a massive bubble and even if a lot of data center capability being built may end up not being used, companies such as GOOG and AAPL could escape this unscathed, unlike NVDA, MSFT, META etc. And the market seems to confirm this atleast at the moment. 

Now this does not mean that AAPL and GOOG are totally immune if the general market were to take a hit. It is just that they may sell off less than their peers. And could bottom sooner than the rest. If you are a regular reader, you know how bullish I was on AAPL and GOOG only a few months ago at prices about 35-50% below current prices on both of these names. Now it is one thing loading up on GOOG at 150 and it is a different ballgame loading up at 300. But at end of the day I see GOOG remain supported on dips into 250-260 area. 

On the S&P500 side, you have these lows from last week at 6520 which are sacrosanct. If we going to break thru these, I expect significant volatility. 

Now, historically Thanksgiving week tends to be bullish with Wednesday and Friday usually Green days. However, you have some parallels going back to 2022 with current market action. 

On one hand you have leading AI stocks under pressure. At the same time you have Orderflow names like GOOG and AAPL well supported. While this could look good on paper, this is the exact same set up we saw before 2022 Bear market started, so I will keep an eye out on the likes of NVDA, MSFT, and TSLA. If AAPL and GOOG start turning South, this could take the whole market down with it to 5900-6000. 

***As far as the week or two ahead go, I will like to see atleast some sort of support if lows from last week are tested. ***

Friday’s auction failed to retest the highs from Thursday, so structurally this presents odds that Friday lows can be retested. On the upside, the bulls have their task cut out for them to retake 6750 and build acceptance above it. We last traded 6630 at time of this post. These are emini December levels. 

> **Scenario 1:** I will fade any rallies into 6800 zone for a push lower into 6650.

> **Scenario 2:** On the downside, 6520 remains support until broken. A break of 6520 could turn this support into resistance. However as long as the support holds, I will like to see a push higher into 6750-6800.

Any AI bulls here could pick any name and see if these recent lows hold— PLTR, NVDA, TSLA, MSFT, take your pick. 

PLTR for instance. I think these levels at 140  remain sacrosanct. If we hold these, we could push higher into 170 again. We last traded 154 at time of this post. 

I do not think AI trade is dead, I just think that the time is ripe for the AI baton to pass from erstwhile winners, like NVDA to the likes of Google for example. Many of these companies like AAPL, GOOG now either have their own chips or will soon have their own chips. If we see news out of the White House about easing of restrictions on NVDA to sell to China, this may just be an opportunity to sell NVDA on rips. Bottomline is AI will now morph from strictly ***NVDA takes all*** to mushrooming of new winners in AI space. These winners are being born as we speak and in weeks and months ahead, I look forward to sharing names which will 5X, 10x from these levels as general market direction becomes clearer. 

**TGT**

Keep an eye out on TGT. 

If the question is has TGT bottomed here so close to $80, what is worth considering is that its nearest rival Costco still sells at a 40 PE. This is even when COST has sold off some 100 points from my last post where I called it overvalued near 950 and shared a long term buy level on Costco. 

Then you have almost 5% dividend yield for a a struggling retailer. I do not think this is sustainable and if the dividend is cut, the stock could get hit. 

Regardless if I were to play TGT as a bottomed out stock, I will consider may be $90 LEAPS on it going out to 2027 or even beyond. 

These January 2027 $90 calls now are $11 or so. I think these calls if had for 4-5 bucks could make sense. These calls have a 50 DELTA so if the stock remains perched here above 80, there may not be a good fill but if we see general market sell off into 6000s, I think these calls could sell down to decent risk to reward levels and could make sense from risk to reward perspective. 

**Oracle **

Oracle appears to be approaching decent support levels for a move back into 240s. 

It is 199 right now. 

I think ORCL could run into decent support at 170s. 

I like ORCL MARCH 20 PUT of 170 Strike if had for 3 dollars. 

I also like ORCL MARCH 20 250 DOLLAR CALL if can be had for like 3 bucks.
