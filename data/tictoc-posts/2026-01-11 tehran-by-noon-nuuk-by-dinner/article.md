# Tehran by Noon. Nuuk by Dinner. 

*Weekly Plan 1.11.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 11, 2026*

As we move from the cooler months of winter toward spring in the coming weeks, it’s worth remembering that the markets, much like seasons, move in cycles.

Last April, when the so-called “Liberation Day” sell-off began to unfold, the bulk of the damage was concentrated in the front end of the move. The S&P 500 plunged nearly 20% in a matter of days, only to retrace the entire decline and then some — eventually pushing on to fresh all-time highs.

That violent sell-off, followed by an equally abrupt policy reversal from the Trump administration, led many to conclude that the administration was never truly committed to de-globalization. 

I beg to differ.

In this post, I will lay out why I believe the de-globalization impulse remains very much alive, why the old global order is effectively finished, and why Trump’s reversal was less a change of panicked heart than a tactical pause to buy time and prepare. Finally, I’ll explain why I believe the April 2025 lows are likely to be revisited.

Over long stretches of time, people like to say “stocks only go up.” That’s true in the same way it’s true that people live longer now—conveniently ignoring all the unpleasant years in between.

Infact this is the very reason why not everyone who trades is a billionaire — most do not have stomach or temperament for this kind of volatility. They do not have patience.  If it were easy, every one of us will be running an ETF or a hedge fund beating the benchmarks and peers. 

Yes, the S&P 500 has averaged roughly 10% a year over the last century. But in any given year, a 20–30% drawdown can show up out of nowhere, with no invitation and no warnings.

**This isn’t just a long-term phenomenon either.** Even on intraday timeframes, the same pattern repeats. The cash session runs about six hours, and each hour has its own personality. More than half the day’s volume typically trades in the first two to three hours, after which markets often settle into a slower, almost sleepy rhythm.

You’re free to ignore this basic truth about markets -- but if you do, they’ll eventually remind you. And they tend not to be so gentle about it.

Without further ado, let us jump into some key themes for week ahead, as well as let us drill down into some of the longer term forces that are acting on these markets. 

Primarily you have 3 main forces that area acting on the current stock market- 

1. Shifting demographics: why 'people trends' are becoming a major market factor.
2. Darkening outlook for tech industry: share my thoughts about increasingly cloudy outlook for big tech.
3. Geopolitics and related markets: How global politics are rippling through the markets.

To understand any of this, you first have to understand what actually drives markets in the first place. And that’s where most people already get lost.

Have you ever stopped to ask why markets go up at all? Not why they went up yesterday, or after the last CPI print -but why the whole thing has an upward bias to begin with?

**The driver or the engine behind “stocks only going up” is a steady drip of money from savings** and other sources flowing into the risk-on assets almost continually. This money comes from 3 major sources: 

1. Retail investor money.
2. Institutional money.
3. Money creation by Central Banks.

When this money stops flowing in, or worst, it starts flowing out, this is what creates bear markets. 

Now the section below is a little long winded, but I have to do this to explain my theory on major problems for stocks in years ahead. 

While the majority of market liquidity originates from the three primary sources mentioned, significant capital also enters the ecosystem through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and corporate share buybacks from highly profitable firms like Apple and Meta.

**Despite the prevailing myth that retail investors represent 'dumb money,'** the reality is that retail capital is one of the primary engine of the public markets. A single retail trade, made by our imaginary trader friend (let’s call him Timmy), like a single PUT or a CALL option on the SPY—may be a drop in the ocean. However, when millions of individuals receive their paychecks every 2 weeks and trigger automated 401(k) contributions and employer matches, it creates a massive, relentless inflow of capital. This collective, programmatic buying by the 'Timmys' of the world provides the underlying liquidity that moves the entire market.

Now, let us take an example of how this plays out in the US stock market which is the largest and most liquid of all stock markets globally. 

There are millions of so-called Timmys working in thousands of different industries in the US, they are saving money and are regularly, but passively investing into stocks and ETFs. So far so good. However, as a nation, we are getting older. Our archetypical Timmy who is rich and successful today, and hence most invested in the stocks is pushing past 40 now. Most of our super wealthy and successful Timmys now are even 50 and some are well into their 60s. 

**At some point in the near future, this older cohort will collectively exit the workforce.** The market’s continued ascent relies on the assumption that younger Timmys will step into those high-earning roles, increase their savings rates, and pick up the slack. For the cycle of passive inflows to continue indefinitely, the incoming generation must not only match the buying power of their predecessors but exceed it, effectively backfilling the capital that retirees will inevitably begin to withdraw.

**But this is not as simple as it sounds.** So for instance, the latest college graduates right now have a 40% unemployment rate and probably set to get worst. The younger generation is not only having a hard time finding a meaningful, well paying job, their meagre savings are also being eaten rapidly by high interest rates on auto loans, student loans, as well as extremely high housing costs. 

**So this is a vicious cycle. **A younger person is not only not able to save more money, but is actually not able to make enough money to even get by. This was not an issue faced by someone who was born 30-60 years ago. 

They had a much more different reality growing up. The economy worked for them better for lack of a better term. They were able to get high paying jobs with relative ease — for 40 years since 1980, the interest rates have been on a downward trend, their cost to borrow was cheap. The houses they bought were purchased at 50-80% lower prices than what they are now. 

**They just had a lot of free cash to keep investing passively into the stocks and ETFs. **

So you can see how lack of cash flow for our younger folks is an existential threat to the US financial system as a whole— if they do not make money, they do not save, if they do not save, they will not invest. If they do not invest, the music stops. 

If this were not enough, as our older generations retire, most of them will pull money out of stocks, sitting on these tech stocks which on average have tripled and quadrupled in last 5 years alone. **Do you blame them? **What if the stocks crash 50% in next 3 years, many of them will have to go back to live with their kids who do not have much to start with! 

Instead of putting money into stocks, any one who is 55-60 or older, may be actively selling stocks, and putting this money to money market funds which are already plump and paying a very decent return at 4%.! 

**Now in the US, fortunately, many of these issues are solvable if we can find high paying jobs for our latest generations.** The good thing is that we just have a lot of younger people who can pay into the system built on taxation.  But other advanced countries are just not so fortunate. So for instance, the likes of Japan and Canada. Most of the growth in countries like Canada for the past decade was coming from importing tens of hundreds of thousands of younger migrants. Now with right wing populism sweeping globally, I expect migration to any of the western countries to drop to 0. In Canada and US for instance, 20025 saw negative immigration. 

**So if you are with me thus far, you can see how this is a ticking demographic time bomb.** Not only you have older, richer boomers go offline and retire, they stop investing in stocks, they withdraw cash from stocks, and as they become even older, they put extra demand on the system in form of healthcare needs. 

**So this is one major headwind for stock markets and this is unlikely to reverse anytime soon. This could be a generational thing. **

Now the other side of this coin is that the US stocks’ gains, for most part, have come from a handful of stocks. 

In fact if the stocks like META, AAPL, NVDA, even a TSLA with barely any earnings had not done so well, S&P500 today would be at 5000 and not 7000! 

**Now tech companies have a double, if not triple whammy from what is going on in terms of geopolitics. **

First off, I am making a big assumption that Globalization is finished. What does Globalization means anyways? In very basic words, it means you can have a free flow of raw materials, finished goods, and most importantly people between countries without much friction. 

**The friction between the system is increasing! **

While the current administration’s tariffs may be temporary, the geopolitical scars of the last year are likely permanent. We have entered an era of deep-seated institutional distrust that transcends traditional rivalries. It is no longer just about the U.S. versus China or Russia; we are seeing a breakdown in confidence between historic allies, where even nations like Canada and Denmark are viewing one another through a lens of strategic skepticism. 

**This shift is structural, not political,** and it cannot be undone by a simple change of guard in Washington in 2028. Consequently, the push for localization is the new global norm rather than exception. Supply chains are no longer being built for efficiency, but for survival — driving a massive migration of manufacturing back to the U.S. or into aligned vassal states like Mexico.

Now if you are a ketchup maker like Kraft Heinz or you make Cigarets or even Diet Coke, you can quickly adapt. There is more than enough tomatoes in the US. But this same thing cannot be said about major tech companies which are literally present in every continent and every little country on the planet — and it does not just mean they are selling there, it means they procure raw materials from there, they procure labor from there, and they assemble their devices there. Like for example an iPhone could have a dozen countries if not more, engaged in manufacturing of an iPhone. 

Tech by its very nature is complicated. The supply chains are complicated. So for Apple to be able to sell an iPhone for $1300 and still make 50% margins on it, they absolutely need globalism. **This should not be confused at all me saying that Apple cannot make an iPhone here in the US. It should be seen as me saying that Apple cannot make iPhone within next 5 years here in the US and it most definitely cannot expect to have a 50% margin on the phone.** 

As Globalism gets more and more damaged, and as tech companies see their costs rise to make their products and as their markets shrink due to competition and anti globalist sentiment, I submit the valuations they have right now cannot be justified anymore. 

Furthermore, this will delay development of new technologies and increase the time it takes to bring and refine existing technologies to the market. 

The other not so talked about aspect of this is that the tech companies’ life line is almost 0% interest rates. While this may not be true for cash flow giants like Apple and MSFT and META today, I will submit that a META or an AMZN would not have been possible without near 0 interest rates last 40 years. 

**What are the interest rates doing now?** Well, even if they are not rising, they are high now. The cost to borrow now is 400-500% higher than it was only 5 years ago. No Bueno. Not good. 

**Last but not the least,** you have the whole situation brewing as far as oil rich countries are concerned. A lot of mainstream folks believe this is to do with US wanting Venezuelan oil or Iranian oil but in my view it is almost herculean task to get this oil as it will need billions in investment, and in particular in case of Iran, a prolonged conflict. 

The US may not after all be about getting oil itself but ensuring Chinese cannot get it from Iran. 60% of all Chinese oil comes from Iran and I think this will culminate within days with a US strike of Iranian oil installations. 

As I said in my last weekly post, this is a new global race for securing natural resources— oil, minerals, sea and air trade routes, strategic military outposts. I will not at all be surprised if the US next takes Greenland. In this new Global race for natural resources, the previous Global race or the so called Globalization has been cancelled. 

We can sum this up by observing that the market action in recent weeks seems to validate what I am saying. Yes, Google and AMD and Microns of the world have had excellent runs— but it is not because they found some new product or some new billion dollar idea. It was due to factors not really fundamental to their continued operations. It was due to mis-pricing  to start with, and in cases like Micron these new supply shortages in memory. 

We see fundamental based rallies in Gold and Silver miners, we see these rallies in oil stocks of all the stocks! We see strong rallies in Dividend payers which tend to be non tech anyways. 

**For me personally the conclusion of this analysis is**— 

1. Dark days ahead for the US large tech stocks. This is not short term and may take time to rollover. But once this realization sets in, downside move will be rapid. And vicious.
2. You’re probably looking at stronger oil and stronger Silver and Gold in weeks to months ahead.
3. Once this misguided adventurism fails, if the oil markets see a significant supply shock, you are looking at higher oil prices in 70s rather than under 50. This means higher inflation shock. Which could mean fewer rate cuts this year.
4. Once the bear market begins, due to reconfiguration of demographics and geopolitics as explained above, I think this dip will be deeper and could stay at the lows for a long time rather than a fast V shaped recovery unlike the dips of last 10 years.

Despite excellent rally last week, which coincidentally came as the stocks low ticked my support levels, I think the main level to watch in days ahead is going to be 6890-6900. 

We last closed at 7006 on emini S&P500. 

**This could help Gold/Silver and Gold/Silver miners but there is an important nuance. **

You know despite the case I submit about long term prognosis of tech stocks, what we meed is some sort of confirmation. If we do not have a confirmation, if I am short here, I can easily take another 10%, another 15% heat. This is why I need a confirmation. 

**This confirmation comes via a series of closes below 6850-6900. **

If we cannot even dip below 6900, and stay there for 2 days, I am afraid the line of least resistance still appears up. You still have momentum going for the likes of Google. The likes of Micron. The likes of AAPL. This is why I am not yet comfortable being on the short side of the tape. And I think this is why this market has been buying these dips, any little dips. 

Eventually the thesis I painted above, about demographics, about harsher realities facing the tech sector will be realized by these markets and we could get a nice ride down. Alas, I do not think that is today. 

This is why when TSLA was 400 and some famed investor turned furus were calling for a collapse, I said no not so fast. 

What did TSLA did in days and weeks later? It traded up into $500! 

**On the week itself, I will lean on this 6955-6967 level as important**. 

> **Scenario 1:** You have the SCOTUS on Wednesday which was postponed from Friday, and right under us I think this is an important zone carved out which if falls could be first signs of trouble in the paradise. If 6956 continues to hold, we could remain bid and I think we are ready to test 7050s.

> **Scenario 2:** If we break 6956, stay below it I think we can retest 6892. We last traded 7006. These are emini levels. For SPX, please subtract about 40 points from these levels.

**Other ideas **

As I said earlier, if this rally can sustain itself, it obviously favors names like MU and GOOG. If you recall, I shared MU back when it was in 60s. Nice run since then, isn’t it. 

On GOOG, I shared the $300 support just few weeks earlier and the stock has since rallied some 30 points. I think momentum could take it to 350 if not more. In all these “AI type” stocks, I think Google has positioned itself to win big. 

On some of the more speculative names, if you recall I had a huge bullish bias on ASTS back when it was in its infancy, the stock was in 20s. 

Similar story as Micron, a huge runner in 2025 alone. 

I think ASTS still has more juice left to squeeze. A short term line in sand could be at 70-80, but I think this probably tests 130-150. It is now 97. 

**Where does this leave us with names like SLV ? **

Pursuant to my post a few days earlier, my long term bias on this is up. I expected a deeper dip and I even shared a short term PUT in SLV which went from $1.5 to about $2.3 but I decided to scratch it and since then SLV is up another 10% or so. 

This whole Iran situation is the new information in the market and I think the situation is on cusp of deteriorating, this is why despite a surge in the stocks, SLV also remained so firm all thru last week.

![](images/img_00_24a1408bcc7b.jpg)

The way Silver and Gold markets read events of last few days is that look here is this Super power under Trump flexing its muscle globally, and none of their allies in form of China or Russia can come to help them. This is one of those things where if Russia does not do anything, it helps Silver. If it does end up doing something, that definitely is jet fuel for something like SLV. Now unlike Eastern cultures like China and India where Silver actually has industrial or ornamental uses, here in the US it has been turned into a speculative, financial vehicle.  This is why you heard of rumors of JP Morgan ensnared in promises of delivering about 300 tons of Silver on its positions while it only had a ton available. I do not know how much there is to rumors, but if true, this is an additional tailwind for Silver. 

I would think if you do not see SLV trade down below 65 or 66, it is probably headed higher into 80s from here. It is 72 at the moment. 

**INTC**

With this type of stocks like Intel and even MP, these tend to have a little bit of ‘nationalistic’ fervor in this age of anti-globalist sentiment. 

So if you recall, I first shared Intel at 20s before it more than doubled. MP was an orderflow stock is 10s before it jumped to 100s. 

I think these could continue to do well but if the General market were to dip, there could be volatility. 

INTC as instance, I see this remain supported in low 40s, even mid 30s, I think this is headed much higher once we clear 50. It is about 45 at the moment.
