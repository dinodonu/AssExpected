# Daily Plan 8.7.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 07, 2025*

Hey folks- 

So you can see there are quite a bit of “information distortions” in these markets at the moment, driven primarily by the President himself. This is very different from the past where you could make an educated guess about policy or a certain stance on an issue, from the administration in terms of fiscal, trade policy which tended to hold for a few months at least. Today, this is changing by the day and sometimes even within hours. 

If you recall, as an example, I shared a bullish play on AAPL at 200, with a target of 230. This stock had really not gone anywhere for several months, and looked quite bleak only 2 days ago, but based on positive signals from the President, the stock is up more than 10% within a day! Then you have other examples like TSLA getting another lease on life from that 300 because “*Musk is a good man*”, said the President. You have Intel shedding 5% overnight because the “*CEO has lots of conflicts and MUST resign*”. 

The net conclusions from these if any are, **a)** this market remains under an upward drift naturally due to the flamboyance and ample fiscal liquidity that is readily available. I have said this several times before that don’t expect this to just U-Turn unless and until this control is lost. **b)** you have these distortions in the short term, where you may not be privy to the insider info but there are others who know this well ahead of these announcements and proclamations. This creates a distorted market between the “*insider info haves*” and the insider info “*have-nots*” in the short term. 

We can only protect ourselves in this by sharpening our pencils with fairer and better levels, more researched context. Like how can you even model all this using indicators and charts and trend lines? You can only look for clues on tape, like we saw on AAPL at 203 with billions of dollars of dark pool volume surging, a few hours before the tariff relief announcement. 

On the intraday time frame, you had a historic rate cut from the Bank of England in night. They had to vote twice just to confirm the rate cut. Then you have the 30 year bond auction at noon which may be important. 

We can lean on the overnight highs at 6428 as potential support and overnight lows at 6380 as potential support if tested. We are now last trading 6410. 

> **Scenario 1:** If we test and hold 6380, this level could be supported for a retest of 6428.

> **Scenario 2:** For further gains here, I will like to see 6428 broken, else this could be intraday resistance.
