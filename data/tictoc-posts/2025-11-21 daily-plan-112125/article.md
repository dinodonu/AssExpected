# Daily Plan 11.21.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 21, 2025*

Folks— this was the largest intraday reversal in S&P500 going back to April, the index was up almost 2% and then at 6800 which was the orderflow target from last night, we  started selling off to close in the red. 

Nasdaq was even more dramatic with a 5% intraday high to lows swing! 

What you have is deleveraging in crypto space in my view keeping pressure on these markets. I personally do not think this is necessarily driven by valuation concerns (yet), this is programatic selling driven by either the correlated markets or insider news. 

Furthermore, if we are going to begin sliding below **6511-6520** zone, this could lead to a retest of what is out there at **6403**. 

We last traded 6578 on the emini S&P500. 

**Some levels for the session tomorrow: **

> **Scenario 1: **I will like to see atleast some support come in at 6511 for a move higher into 6560.

> **Scenario 2:** We could see resistance at 6620-6630 if tested for a push lower into 6511.

A break lower below 6511 could see 6511 present as resistance. On the flip side, you have 6620 as a major reference point which needs to be overcome by the bulls.
