# Daily Plan 11.5.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 04, 2025*

Hey traders- 

The yesterday cash session high was some 6 points under the weekly intermediate resistance at 6917 and thus far we have seen some volatility in the European and asian sessions. 

We are as a matter of fact trading the weekly support level at 6821 at time of this post. 

I will watch this **6840** level in the cash session. If this holds as resistance, I think we can push down into the **6762** area. 

Conversely, if we manage to find some bidding and acceptable above 6840, this could trade into 6860 which could be intraday resistance. 

Outside of day to day levels, this is a little bit of unexplained sell off — which carries a bit more weight than your run of the mill sell offs. I think we need to close the session above 6820 today, else this could indicate a little more softness ahead.
