# Momentum. 

*Daily Plan 1.7.26*
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 07, 2026*

So pursuant to the post this AM, we barely did any business below 6940. We did not even bother to test 6930. 

What you have is this market front running lot of data and news that it perceives as positive for risk on.. 

If you want some selling here, you need to see atleast few of these support levels give up. For instance 6930. Interim, I think due to momentum we can continue to trade higher. 

Now this market has spent a lot of time in balance. This is a big data week. If bears can keep it within balance, that is to say keep a lid on 7000, it is potentially good for them in weeks ahead. 

However, this is a market breathing at the top end of range. Even if this breakout ends up failing, this can stop out a lot of folks on the wrong side of the tape. This is why I think the bulls remain in charge unless cold water is poured and we come down below 6956 or so. 

Here are a couple of potential key levels for the session tomorrow. 

> Scenario 1: 6956 or so could be in play. If this continues to hold, we can remain supported on dips.

> Scenario 2: I further think if this market were to test recent contract high at 7015 either overnight or in initial balance tomorrow in the cash session, and then comes down to retest 6970 or so, could make another push higher into 7015 or so.

Now before I sign off, I want to address few questions on Silver. First off I shared a Silver short term PUT which appears to go to 0. As a lotto, this is just a short term call not some major shift in my view on precious metals. It really is a one dollar put. In my view, the silver rally holds merit, at these particular levels, if and only if there is going to be some major geopolitical mishap in next few days to weeks. Now my guess if this is the case is as good as anyone else’s. I simply do not know. I do not think anyone knows. Can anyone predict this using chart?

I shared this and several other gold and silver miner stocks 1-2 years ago at prices which were 60-80% lower. Now here at 80-90 bucks an ounce, it is hard for me to fit it in my fair value models. Problem with these commodities is since they do not have any cash flow, or any other fundamental valuations, they can be very heavily influenced by mania, momentum and positioning.  Often they go parabolic and flat line, or worst they collapse. I could be very wrong and silver could double and triple here. This really does not mean we will not find other ideas with better conviction and prices which could do even better. What I am definitely confident in my view is about is a good base in Gold between 3500 and 4000. I think this is here to stay. Outside of this, if I do not understand something I will not trade it. This is true for unfair prices as well as out of the norm volatility. This silver situation is akin to what we had in intraday S&P500 back in April. If S&P500 is moving 400-500 points a day, regardless of price, is it a good idea to take undefined risk, short term positions in it?
