# Daily Plan 12.2.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Dec 02, 2025*

Hey folks— 

As shared on Sunday, we see bullish activity above that weekly secondary level at 6816. 

For the session today, I will move this secondary level up into 6825-6830. 

> Scenario 1: If we open and remain bid above 6825, I think we can trade 6870, and if broken via a **Daily Close above 6870**, we should then set out sights on 6903.

> Scenario 2: If we are able to break 6825 on downside and remain below 6816-6825, I still see support kick in at weekly support levels near 6740 and these dips could be supported, unless we begin to see DAILY time frames closes below 6740.
