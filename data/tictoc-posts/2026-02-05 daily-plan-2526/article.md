# Daily Plan 2.5.26

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Feb 05, 2026*

This whole Bitcoin situation remains to be closely watched folks as it can have a cascading effect on other risk on markets. 

What you have is a very large player here with a 50+ billion dollar position and if things do not ameliorate soon for the bitcoin bulls, it can have disastrous outcomes for some in this game. Since Bitcoin is now tightly integrated with several derivatives, ETFs, notes — you name it, this can have a systemic effect if things amplify to the downside below 70K. 

Now when you listen to some of this messaging from some of these players, even inside the administration, you hear these things like from this morning “if we do not invest and support crypto (read bitcoin), then China will edge us out in bitcoin”. 

This is a laughable statement. 

Like who in their right minds believes that China is actually stacking Bitcoin? 

If anything, these countries are all stacking more and more Gold. There is a race to stockpile resources, oil, metals, minerals— I do not think there is any competition amongst sovereigns to stack Bitcoins. 

In fact, any sovereign who had previously warmed up to Bitcoin, have now been quietly offloading them. 

This whole Crypto thing, here in the US, is a speculative vehicle. There is really no use case. If anything, these countries like China have been focussed on the utility side of crypto— CBDC. I understand the motives for a true Bitcoin Maxi— I know why they think what they think, but I am under no illusion that Big corporations like AAPL, GOOG, Berkshire, a Costco, an Indian or a Chinese central bank are any closer to having Bitcoin in their reserves. It is not gonna happen. I will buy it as a quick trade, if a perfect storm leads it to dump into 30-40 range. But this is not my long term “buy and holds” like. VYMI, VOO, SCHD- you get the gist. 

Now within Crypto, what is not dumping? That Hype token I shared a few days ago— it actually has a use case. The company selling it can actually make some money of it. Not thru rug pull but actual transaction fees and a platform for decentralized trading. 

Anyways, I digress. 

So despite all of this, and pretty much a rout in leading software stocks, emini has been pretty well bid— albeit with tremendous intraday volatility. 

If we are going to crater here, I definitely think some of these highs here near 7000, 7050 need to hold else the bearish case is weakened (read voided).  

The bears so far have done a good job but the dips do get purchased. 

What is helping the bears? Look at the type of stocks that are rallying — the value type names, the oil refiners, oil servicing companies, even a Mccormick today. The fact that these are rallying means a weak bullish case for big tech to start with. 

So you saw what happened with META? I had a bearish view on it, over the earnings, the stock ripped, and is now down 10% from those highs. Not a healthy rally. 

So, this is not a good picture if you consider all the related markets for bulls. 

As far as intraday levels go, we can perhaps see if there are any takers above the highs today near 6960-6970. 

I would be hesitant to call all clear for the bulls unless we take some trades above 6970. I think this could be intraday resistance for a move down into 6911. 

If we continue to hold 6970 thru what’s left of the week and actually manage a close below 6900-6911, I think this portends well for a bearish continuation next week into 6720s.
