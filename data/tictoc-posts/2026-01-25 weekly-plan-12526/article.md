# Weekly Plan 1.25.26

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 25, 2026*

Traders— 

As we head into another trading week, we are looking at a giant range formation where the dips have been bought, often at our support levels, and rallies have been sold, again many a times at our exact resistance levels. 

Looking at the week ahead, you have the FOMC as well as looming Government shutdown. The Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs can also come in at some point during the week. 

While the markets gyrate thru these choppy waters, our stance remains clear — we will wait for the right set ups, for undervalued names at fair prices and go in, often before explosive moves. I do not like to chase after the explosive moves. I like to find companies and ideas in infancy of accumulation. 

When you look at the general market as a whole, you need to understand the role of time frames. Generally, in intraday, the market is nothing more than a casino. Now some may argue that is not the case, that the markets in short term are exact art and science, but I do not subscribe to this thought. And I been doing it over 25 years now. 

In the intraday time frames, for the 6-7 hours that the markets open, it is nothing more than a casino. You want to exploit your edge to eke out a consistent earning. You want to perfect and hone a system that will give you consistent profits each day— think of it as making a living in the markets. When you deal with intraday markets you are wearing hat of a short term, speculative punter. This same thought process extends to options. Most of my options shared here tend to be 1-3 dollar options. I go into an option trade with an expectation that it will go to 0 most likely. It so often transpires that many of these options turn out to be 2x, 5x, even 10X winners. But that does not come about every day. May be there are 7-8 weeks out of the 52 in a year, that we have solid option setups— a lot of things have to come together to make this happen. Volatility, mis-pricing by option sellers, a general sense of uncertainty. Some thing broken in the system that you can take advantage of. 

Then, as a long term investor, depending on your goals and other factors like cost of living and age,  I want to stay invested in stocks. You do not wanna sell.  

If I am just starting out as an investor, and assuming I have never owned a single share of S&P500 when it was 2000, or 3000, or a 4000, I want to employ a Dollar Cost Average Strategy. Predicting when the next big 20% or a 40% sell off materializes is sucker’s play. So I would rather buy some at 6800, I would rather buy some at 6500, I would buy more at 6000 and I will buy a lot more at 5000— you get the gist. End goal is to accumulate as many income producing, dividend yielding assets as possible, spread over decades, not even years. One of my long term goals has been to save atleast of 10% what I make and Dollar cost average it into scarce assets every single year — since I like to sleep at night, I do not put this into high beta, speculative names but usually the very best, scarce American and international cash cows using instruments like VYMI, VTI, VOO, VIG, SCHD, EEM etc to name a few. If there is volatility during the year, and by that I really mean a 20-30% sell off, I add more. It is easy to be lulled into a safe sense of security holding dollars, or expecting a large sell off right around the corner. But in my experience years can fly without end of the world type scenarios, and dollar as you all know has been consistently losing value every single day. 

The third aspect of what we do is to find individual stocks which are at really depressed and hence fair prices. This can also be very lucrative, given that you are able to find these before others do. As a rule than an exception, the general public likes to chase stocks at higher prices as it feels the safest when the stock is making a move higher. Nothing could be farther from truth. At highs, a lot of good news has been priced in or close to be priced in. So recent examples abound everywhere— from Gold to Silver to Oil stocks. As a sample case, SLV was shared here first by me when it was 17. GLD was at 150! XOM, the oil stock itself is up 35% within a matter of months. These are not typical moves in these type of stocks! So you can see my hesitation to feel so strongly about SLV at 90 if I did not buy a single share at 17! I have a very fine tuned system which often means price is not everything to me. Until and unless some other conditions match, I do not necessarily care about price — high or low but the conditions matter much more to me. 

The bottomline is the longer your time frame, more patience you will need. You will need to sit thru chop and often you will need to wait for months if not year if you want to get in at fair prices. 

On the short term, options, intraday S&P500 trades, you will need a certain level of accuracy and execution edge. Far from being patient, you will have to be ruthless with killing your losers and letting the winners run 2-3X. You need to develop “Trust issues” for lack of a better term, if you don’t already have those, in order to survive the vagaries of intraday moves. 

This is not really my feelings either. Math supports this. Edge in markets is not a very high accuracy, edge in trading comes from having a very high win size compared to your average loser. 

Now as we enter a brand new trading week, you will see a lot of stocks still making new highs but these are not the right ones for the index to also make new highs. 

So the big tech, mega caps have been languishing. They need to catch up if we are going to break out of this rut. 

Interim, for the week, these range highs near 6980-7000 could remain in play as potential resistance. 

On the downside, you have the lows from last week in play as potential support levels. 

> **Scenario 1:** For the week, if we are trading down into 6870 and unable to hold these levels is a good sign for the bears. I think if we break 6870 to the downside and fail to hold above it, then I think we are headed lower into 6720s next.

Right now I expect dips to get supported and the reason being that while you have the mega caps in a rut here, you could see a few of these actually rally and take the market with them. 

So for instance AMD has been a tremendous orderflow runner from that 90 level and most recently found bidders again near 200. 

If you filter out the noise from these chip stocks, or of late these memory stocks, on IT and electronics stocks as a whole, I think what AI does in next year or two is erode away profitability of a lot of these mega caps. It is hard to pick which one wins and which one loses out, but you would think existing leaders like MSFT and GOOG could continue to benefit from erosion in profitability of their peers. 

This is why I am hesitant to call any sort of tops in these stocks like GOOG and MSFT. They are large and diverse in their businesses to mitigate the loss of profit margins elsewhere. If you are bear on the general market, you would very much like to see a break lower in these 2 stocks. 

We last traded 6935 on emini. For those on SPX, please subtract about 15 points from these prices. 

**Other themes **

So if you have been reading this publication of late, since last few months the push has been on localization rather than globalization. This is what has fed the monster rallies in some of these orderflow stocks like Intel, resource rich companies like NEM, KGC, Hecla. 

This trade could still have legs and on smaller players, there are a couple I think which could still win big. 

**SKYT**

This is an extremely volatile small cap, it has pulled back quite a bit. 

With these type of stocks know that large drawdowns in my view are the norm than the exception. 

Yes, it looks nice here at 30s for a push into 40s. But it could be sweeter if it pulled back into low 20s for a push higher into 40s. Take a look and lemme know what you think. 

**ALM **

This is another relatively small cap. I am liking this action in this stock. I think it remain supported on any pullbacks, in my view this is probably a 20-25 dollar stock not a $10 one! 

Then in other international markets, look at the likes of Brazilian stocks. I think while the US takeover of Venezuela gets solidified in next few months to a year this could help stock markets in the vicinity. 

EWZ as a way to play Brazilian markets I think looks robust here near 36 and I am a buyer on any dips into 30s as well for an eventual push higher into 50s. 

**McCormick**

So as MKC drops lower into 50s, may be mid 50s, its book value should come in around 2. I think if I were to take a 2-5 year view on MKC, it makes sense to own this longer term nearer to 50 as it is about 60 now. 

**Netflix **

With Netflix, if you had my chat update below, it is now up about 6 points from that 80 support handle. 

While I think NFLX is value now, due to momentum and especially if we see a dip in the general market, I will not be surprised if it were to sell lower towards 70 where I think it represents a great risk to reward for a move higher into 120 and then 150s.
