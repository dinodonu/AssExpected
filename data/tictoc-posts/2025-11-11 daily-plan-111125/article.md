# Daily Plan 11.11.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 11, 2025*

Hey folks- 

Pretty strong action in indices today off that government shutdown ending. 

Tomorrow we lean on this 6821 level as potential support. 

If the level is tested and if we do not do much business under it, the highs from today could be retested. I think if we hold 6821, we could retest the highs near 6903 at some point in week. 

In 0DTE, these 6900 SPX CALLS which are now 90 cents, if had around 25-40 cents could be good from intraday lotto perspective.
