# Liquidation! 

*Daily Plan 10.17.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Oct 17, 2025*

Hey traders- 

Overnight the market conditions have worsened and there is absolute horror show in crypto markets with traders getting liquidated left and right. 

There was a lot of leverage and even more complacency in the markets. This is not some bear market I think, but this is liquidation event and this is not necessarily a bad thing as assets move from hands of those who margined at the top for making quick buck, to those who trade and hold spot for the long run. 

However as far as liquidations go, no one knows when they end but we want to be prepared. 

In the intraday time frame, 6540 may be important level for intra day time frame support. 

> **Scenario 1: **As long as we now remain below 6660 to 6683, rallies could be sold into lows near 6580.

> **Scenario 2:** If we find support at 6540, some relief can be had for these markets.

In longer term, you have now some structural weakness here between entirety of 6660 and 6711 which needs to be repaired. I am watching tape all day to see for signs of stability and buying. I did not see one all day yesterday, may be we see that today. Or Monday.  Will keep you posted. 

These are intraday levels, auction is unfolding every day, will be sharing some longer term support levels on all major markets like NVDA, Bitcoin and TSLA in the weekly, stay tuned. TSLA I think remains close to decent support which I talked about it a couple weeks ago but will share updated view again. 

Plan has been opened to all due to volatility. Share and subscribe to help other traders, like your self.
