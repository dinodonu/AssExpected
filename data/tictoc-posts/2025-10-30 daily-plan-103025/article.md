# Daily Plan 10.30.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Oct 30, 2025*

Hey folks - 

So yet again, we saw our support level see almost the exact low in the session today. Very nice level. 

A lot of uncertainty in short term was taken off the table today. If you are expecting this level to break you have to ask where is uncertainty going to come from? Where is catalyst? 

We can again lean on this level from today at 6890. 

I think if we hold 6890 and cannot find offers below this, we are headed to $7000 on emini S&P500. 

SHOPIFY 

I became bull on SHOP at 50 bucks, it has now traded into 178. 

Earnings are next week.

What you have right now is everyone piling into NVDA at whatever price they can get. 

If you want a good sell off you want NVDA softness. If this is up another 2-3% tomorrow, it takes emini with it. 

This is why I favor a confirmation below of some sorts near 6890. Else we can remain supported due to momentum in NVDA alone.
