# Buy dip. 

*Daily Plan 12.18.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Dec 18, 2025*

Hey friends— 

So an AI mega cap stock onslaught keeps the general market index under pressure though the breadth of this market remains robust suggesting that big money may be moving from too much AI concentration into other sectors and industries. 

For instance, watch this NVDA stock here so close to 167-168. 

I think this is a very important zone and needs to hold for atleast another move back into 180. 

In a very short term trade, this 175 Dollars December 16th NVDA CALL if had around a dollar makes sense from risk to reward. It is right below 2 bucks at the moment. 

For the session tomorrow, keeping an eye out on 6730-6743 level which may be important support. 

> Scenario 1: If I am going to be a bear here to target 6692, I need to see 6730 fold and we remain below it. Else this level could be supported for move back into 6818.

**To summarize:** 6630-6643, as short term support and 6818 as potential short term resistance,  are key levels for me on the session tomorrow, and as a matter of fact what remains of this week. 

Remember— **the key event risk for the session on Friday**, and the overnight session tomorrow will be the Bank of Japan. 

Inflation has become a major issue for Bank of Japan. They are widely expected to raise rates tomorrow to 0.75% which is a big deal as historically near 0 rates in Japan have fueled the stock market gains, specifically in the US. 

While the rate hike may be baked in, the language around it may not be. 

If the market perceives the statement as dovish, this could be bullish. On the flip side, if they come out too hawkish, this could be a problem. While the $USDJPY exchange is at short term resistance, despite US rate cuts, the trend appears upwards, suggesting again that these dips in stocks here in the US could benefit the non mega cap like growth stocks. As we get to favorable levels and names, I will be sharing here with my folks soon. Stay tuned.
