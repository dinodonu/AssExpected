# Is NVDA everyone's favorite Piñata now?

*Daily Plan 11.25.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 25, 2025*

Folks — 

Google stock is flying today after it was revealed that META will spend billions of dollars on purchasing Google’s AI chips called Tensor processing units. The stock last traded up to 320 after hours, up another 20 or so bucks from Friday close. NVDA on the other hand dipped 2 % after this news. 

This news is just some more fodder for short sellers against NVDA who have accused NVDA of circular deals, inflating their future revenue projections as well as how the companies deploying NVDA chips view depreciation of these GPUs. 

This is a gentle reminder how fickle and unpredictable the tech industry as a whole can be. The landscape is constantly shifting and in this case, the tape was screaming strength in Google weeks and months before the news today ever printed. 

On the emini side, as a continuation of my post from Friday, we continue to see strong action on the tape from that 6520 low carved out last week. 

This auction today was a robust auction and if we need to see an invalidation of the session strength today, we need to see some price acceptance below 6670. 

As such I will lean on 6670 as potential support tomorrow if tested. 

> **Scenario 1:** 6670 if tested could be a support for a move back into 6720.

> **Scenario 2:** I will like to see sharp rejection at 6750, if tested for a move down into 6670s if 6750 is to hold as resistance going into next session or two. If we begin to see acceptance at 6750 or above 6750 with very little selling pressure, this could take us back to 6800.
