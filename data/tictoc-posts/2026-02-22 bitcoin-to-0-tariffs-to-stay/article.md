# Bitcoin to 0. Tariffs to Stay.

*Weekly Plan 2.22.26*
*Tic Toc Trading — Feb 22, 2026*

As Bitcoin slid towards 60K earlier in the month,  Google searches for “Bitcoin to Zero” spiked in the US, and hit an all time high this last week. 

Normally these are all tell tale signs of a bottom —  here is some food for thought from my perspective. 

The US based large crypto traders have been selling Bitcoin on any rallies. This has been an ongoing trend for several months now. You can see this via analyzing trading activity on Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest crypto exchanges globally. 

Whenever you see a premium in Coinbase over Binance, this is often a tell tale sign of large US traders offloading Bitcoin. Back when Bitcoin hit 125K, various sort of snakes oil salesmen were regurgitating ridiculous targets like 250K and 1 million, some more foolish ones even calling out a 13 million price target on the coin. 

What this did I think was created a trap for late bitcoin bulls and most retail piled into bitcoin at 125 k, before it was cut in half. A far cry from the promised 1300K price target. 

Fast forward some 6 months, while I think 60K is a decent support in bitcoin, and mind you this is the support I shared several days ago before a sizable bump in bitcoin, at end of the day, I think these treasury bitcoin companies are dark clouds hanging on the crypto coins.

**They have to go. **

I have seen this movie numerous times, I personally do not see how the likes of Saylor and tons of these other copy cats do not get bagged. The fact that a stock like XOM, which was dropped from Dow only 5 years or so ago, is outperforming Bitcoin by a factor of almost 4, yes, XOM is up 400% more than Bitcoin over the same time period should be a serious food for thought anyone still clinging to Bitcoin 1 million dollar price target. 

The likes of these snake soil merchants may not be bagged yet,  may not happen for several months going forward, but once and if the bear market starts in the general market, I think all of these treasury companies are going to go bust. Zero. 

Now, you can decide if you wanna make 20-30K on bitcoin buying 60K, or you want to double and triple your money buying a 30K, or even a 10K. 

I think if Saylor were to go bust, we can see very nice low prices on Bitcoin and I will buy it at 10-30K range for long term holding. 

Let us talk about the other elephant in the room here, which is the brewing drama over Trump’s tariffs. 

**Tariffs Are Here to Stay.**

Look, anyone popping champagne over this Supreme Court ruling is missing the forest for the trees.

My take on this Friday’s ruling is that the Supreme Court has sent a clear message to Trump– and a strong message at that– his powers are not infinite and the Courts will step in to curb excessive enthusiasm on the President’s part. This is the very first time the Supreme Court has effectively limited Trump’s powers

The Court ruling leaves a lot of room for confusion and chaos on how the importers like Costco and Walmart will be entitled to refunds. This will be a matter of ongoing litigation.

Yes, the Court basically told the White House that the **IEEPA** isn’t a “magic wand” for taxing imports. It was meant for actual national emergencies, not as a workaround for Congress when you want to overhaul trade policy. It’s a win for constitutional nerds and checks and balances, sure. But for everyone else? It’s just a change in paperwork.

If you’re a business owner or an exporter in Europe, don’t get comfortable. Here’s the reality of what’s actually happening:

If you’re sitting on a pile of tariff receipts hoping for a refund check, I wouldn’t hold my breath. We’re entering a “gray zone” where:

1. Refunds are a pipe dream: Expect months, if not years, of legal limbo.
2. The “Wait and See” Tax: The uncertainty alone is a tax on growth. Nobody wants to invest when they don’t know which industry is getting hit next Tuesday.

This ruling applies to tariffs implemented under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) only, which in the last one year generated roughly $133 billion in import duties.

For  now the questions and uncertainty about how these tariffs remain unanswered. This process can take months if not year. Tens of hundreds of entities and retailers are involved, so this is not an automatic on or off switch. **These tariffs are not going away.**

**The Sledgehammer or Scalpel Dilemma**

The Trump admin has been preparing for months now to how to circumvent the Supreme Court.

It will now use one or all of the below options to bypass this ruling:

- Section 301 (unfair trade practices)
- Section 232 (national security)
- Section 122 (balance of payments issues)
- Section 338 (discrimination against US exports).

The administration just lost its sledgehammer (the IEEPA), so they’re reaching for the scalpel. Instead of broad, sweeping tariffs, expect them to lean hard on Section 301 and Section 232 investigations.

- The targets? Think high-value sectors like autos, chemicals, and pharma. This is supported by recent moves in stocks like NVO for instance.
- The result? It’s actually more annoying. These targeted strikes are harder to lobby against and can be just as expensive. The “building” of protectionism isn’t being torn down— they’re just swapping out the scaffolding. Same thing in a different form.

**So to summarize, **all of these options above are available at Presidents’s disposal. Some short term, some longer term and yet some needing Congress approval.

As long as the Congress remains heavily leaning right, the President has considerable horsepower to implement his trade policy.

**So, where does this leave us with  *****Stonks*****:**

If you read my post from last week, you will see this market stayed pretty much balanced within the levels I shared earlier in the week. 

I warned against excessive bearishness unless we went below 6810 and then I shared a weekly time frame resistance level which was as a matter of fact the weekly high. We were unable to break out of this range at all throughout the week. 

With this new added uncertainty to the mix, I will again rehash the same thing I said last week— if you are too bearish here, you want to see us clear 6800 and remain below it. Otherwise I think we are headed to retrace 7000 again. 

In the subsequent section, I will share some higher probability levels on the emini S&P500 as well as some stocks and ETFs which I personally think can do well from all this added confusion and turmoil. If you have not already, make sure you subscribe and join my real time chat room below.

Now I will also watch this Friday close itself here above 6900-6906 or so. This could be a tertiary level of some import to watch during the week. 

Here are a couple of price action scenarios to be mindful of as we kick start a new week:

> **Scenario 1:** So, this 6930 or so has been a tremendous resistance thru the last week or so. What I am watching this week is if we are able to do any sort of activity above this level which could signal bullish continuation. A small and shallow pullback into 6010 or so is also not a bad idea as long as we do not start trading below 6900 outright.

> **Scenario 2: **On the downside, if we remain perched here below 6930, unable to hold this, I think 6800 weekly support could remain intact, until taken out.

**To summarize:** this is a balancing market with a large range carved out over last several weeks. If you are expecting some sort of trend formation, you want to see us either break out of here at 7000 or break down below 68000. Until then we could remain range bound here for foreseeable future. 

**Other themes **

If you recall, I have had a bullish view on Gold and Silver most recently sharing a support level on SLV and Hecla which coincidentally was the exact swing low in SLV before a 20% rally. 

Now my fundamental views on Silver versus Gold are well known. Gold is the ultimate store of value and I do think Gold is the real money whereas silver is more speculative and less of a store of value. 

Another key differentiator  here between gold and silver is the fact that silver is just so much easier to bring out of the earth and bring to the market. Due to these reasons, I will remain heavy weight bullish on gold for foreseeable future. 

Gold is now trading 5100 bucks an ounce. If you are a regular reader, you know I shared this at 1600 here in the substack and it has since tripled. 

I am a bull on gold on any sort of pullbacks. 4500. 4000. You name it. I think gold has carved out a long term fair value at 3500 and it unlikely to go below it, atleast until some sort of reset or equilibrium is attained in the world amidst this vacuum created by the US. 

For what it’s worth, Gold does tend to pullback when it is so extended, but this is time different? If it does pullback, I see a 10-20% pullback before buyers swoop in again. 

While we can all agree that may be the US is trying to right several wrongs in context of global trade, the global community does not take it that way — it views all this with suspicion and views the US as being reactionary rather than proactive. 

I think we should see Gold make a run towards 8000 to 10000 an ounce by 2028 or so. 

Look, a lot of folks mistakenly assume that if inflation collapses under Trump, that gold will collapse too. 

This (the inflation narrative)  is actually not why the Gold is going up. The reason gold keeps going higher, whether a war happens or not, whether inflation happens or not, is simply because the US keeps seizing sovereign countries in one garb or the other— so Venezuelans are drug dealers, Iran is a nuclear rogue state, they seized half a trillion dollars of Russian assets held in US/EU accounts. All of this is bullish and I think is not fully priced in yet. It does not matter if we have a Republican or Democratic admin. The trend is not fully baked yet.

This breeds an extreme mistrust of the US backed assets — specifically the dollar and the long bonds. 

Now in my view, every single country out there is buying and hoarding Gold coins. Canada, Indians, Chinese, Russians — you name it. Now you do not hear about this on news, because no one is their right mind is posting memes on Twitter declaring how much Gold they have stacked. There are no gold or orange dots being posted online by a Modi or a Putin. 

Shrewd and extremely professional traders never reveal what they are buying and what prices they are buying. This is trading 101 and is taught to all traders on day one on the trading desk. 

Let us say the Russians reveal we “acquired 50 tons of Gold in 2025 at a price of $4000”. What do you think this will do to the gold prices? 

They will rip higher to 6000. If Russians want to buy more , then why would they want higher prices? They will want no one to find out that they are buying as they accumulate hundreds and thousands of kilograms of gold! 

Wish some one told this to our Michael Saylor who ironically whenever he tweets “ we have acquired this many bitcoins”, the bitcoin prices actually fall. 

One kilogram of Gold is roughly 35 ounces. I think at roughly $150K-$160K a kilo, Gold is cheap right now. 

Do you see a key pattern and difference here? 

I said this months ago and I will say this again— as a real hedge against this new word order, whatever this new world order is, as an insurance, I hold 10 to 20% of my assets in Gold. 

If I feel Gold is overvalued or if I feel Gold is not really a great asset to own compared to the stocks, then I split this across gold and some other related assets. 

For instance, take a look at copper in general. Even if all the uncertainty and geopolitics were to go back in the bag, I would think Copper could remain bid here. 

Is it too late to get in copper now ? These stocks like SCCO were first shared by me in this very substack months ago at 60 bucks! These have all tripled now! The likes of NEM, KGC and Hecla have quadrupled if not gone up 10 fold yet! 

Copper is a very important metal and I think it has room to run. 3 more years of Trump admin could see very nice tailwinds for these type of stocks. 

If you want to mix this thesis of new world order with the mad race for AI related spend and mania, I think these copper stocks look nice. If I were to build a smaller list of what I like in this space, I will come up with below: 

1. A generalized ETF in this space to minimize single stock risk. VAW for instance looks tremendous here. It is 230 and change here but I could see it rally into 350s. Within VAW, I like the likes of APD and LIN.
2. Within industrial metals, COPX which back when I gave at 30 still looks nice at 88 or so.
3. If you throw in a name like ETN which is now trading like 370s, I think it has more room to run towards 500 bucks.

This is a generic list of kind of stuff which I think could still do well even if the general market remains balanced or worse, starts a bearish trend. 

Now if you ask me when do these type of stocks start selling off? While no one can accurately predict all this, I would think if the tech stocks continue to sell off and were selling at a considerable premium to these type of names, so a MSFT down 30-40%, a META down 40% from its highs, I think this could be beginning of the end of bull market in these type of stocks which I just shared. 

On the tech side, remember NVDA earnings have not yet come out and will be a bellwether for AI related tech this next week. 

Tech earnings of late have been lukewarm. META, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA— you name it, the market has not been kind to tech stocks this season at all. 

I will though not draw too many conclusions from this when it comes specifically to NVDA. I think it is better to wait out NVDA earnings to decide if we see finally see some legs in the bearish downtrend in the general market. 

I am not really too bearish on NVDA on these earnings. As a matter of fact, I think the stock if it holds 180 (it is 189 now) could actually push higher into 200s. 

So not getting too perked about prospects of NVDA also meeting similar fate as other tech stocks, unless we go below 180 and stay there. I think these earnings will set the tone of this market for next several weeks to months. 

This is it for now, have a great week ahead.
