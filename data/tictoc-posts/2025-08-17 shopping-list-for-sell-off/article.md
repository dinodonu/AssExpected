# Shopping List for Sell off. 

*Weekly Plan 8.17.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 17, 2025*

Hey guys-

Excited to share another installment of the Weekly Plan series where we share cutting edge and often prescient themes with our subscribers. 

Of late, we have had a tremendous run with our longer dated options (LEAPS) and common stock plays, everything pretty much rallying non stop as the general market tailwinds have been very favorable to us. 

Even our sore-losers in last couple of weeks saw a turn in their fortunes and saw handsome gains added to the so called “erstwhile losers” like Intel and UNH. What a difference a single week makes! Our DJT stock has remained a loser with no redemption in sight, but at this point I think it is at an interesting point in time. If you are in the camp that this is going to 0, then nothing I say will make sense but I do think the technicals look ok. May be it goes to 0 later on in the cycle, I do not think we are there yet and I think it could make another run higher. 

**These are the 3 massive lessons we have learned this year from these markets- **

1. Take a long term view.
2. Split the order into multiple lots (based on metrics like ATR and Value at risk etc)
3. And of course take all trades. Do not put all eggs into one basket.

Sometimes these are very expensive lessons to learn but if we learn collectively as a community from experiences of others, it can save us valuable time and tremendous heartburn. 

A lot of ink has been wasted on calling a stock overvalued and over bought and what not. This is really all analyst talk, in trading such opinions of oversold and overbought are not very useful or profitable. 

In trading, oversold can become even more oversold and expensive can become even more expensive. 

Let us for instance take an example of Palantir. If you are a subscriber, you know the history we have had with this stock. I shared this very early back when it was 6 dollars. Over the ensuing weeks and months, it became more and more over bought. Analysts wasted a ton of ink on calling it expensive at 30, at 50, at 100, at 150. Yet, it kept going higher and higher. We in Substack kept reiterating our bullish bias as it went higher and higher. 

**Why is that? Why don’t we join the chorus and call it overbought too? Short it? **

Well, the reason is that the orderflow methodology will not permit us to do so. We need to see some sort of confirmation on tape. Now don’t get me wrong, this stock could shed 20-30% any day due to some scandal or accounting scam or some black swan event. But if it does, it does not make anyone short at the top a genius, it just makes them lucky. Luck is not a sustainable strategy in markets. A blind squirrel is not going to survive the winter just because he chanced upon one nut. 

Logically if you think about it, PLTR is not really expensive, if you are willing to consider the current structure of this market. The market thinks it is valued appropriately. 

Why sir when you have TSLA which makes about 5 billion dollars a year keeps going up, would PLTR which makes roughly half of that also not keep going up? In fact, PLTR has much better profit to revenues ratios. TSLA is a far more capital intensive business. It requires hundreds of thousands of workers to be paid, it needs factories to be maintained, it needs raw materials, batteries and on top of that it is at mercy of what consumers are feeling about the politics and tweets of Elon any given day. TSLA is much more at the mercy of economic forces than a PLTR ever will be! 

This is why I keep saying PLTR is not expensive **if** the general market keeps going higher, it will also keep going higher. It will start bear market once the general market starts a bear market. 

A better argument here would be made using some context and common sense. This is my argument-

1. PLTR by itself is not overvalued when everything else is also overvalued. The market is willing to buy PLTR at these “overvalued” prices. A better argument is that all stocks are overvalued not just PLTR.
2. But none of this matters, if the general market keeps heading higher, these stocks also will keep heading higher!
3. So this manifests as this— if stocks like TSLA can continue to go higher cuz “Robot is coming soon” , stocks like PLTR can go even higher.

Now I am using this exercise simply as an educational example, a personal opinion of some sort why I have never become bearish on a stock like PLTR. Yet. Your classic indicators like RSI and MACD and whatever valuation methods are being used to short PLTR are fairly useless as this market is not rational at the moment. There are forces acting on this market at the moment which are not considering RSI in their evaluation of which stocks to buy. Or sell.  It is just a different type of market right now, one that is not based on traditional valuation metrics. 

Now I think PLTR at some point will probably head higher into 200. It is already at 177, this is about 40 points higher from my last weekly post on it when I called for a test of 180-200, when this stock was at 140! 

Now, let us say next month or so are rough for the general market, this could mean this stock sells down into 160. May be it fills some gaps at 160. But overall I think this could remain supported for a test of 200, **unless we begin an outright bear market in the general market. **

**Is UPS the next UNH? **

Now this same phenomenon told above can work in reverse too. Is UPS now the next UNH as some furus are convinced? 

The stock does seem cheap at 90. It is selling at 12 PE, pays 8% dividend, RSI is like most oversold it has been in years. So this must double from here, right? 

Well not so quick. When a stock is cheap, there is a reason it is cheap. I think unless UPS were to close back above 100, it is probably headed lower. I think a 70 could be really cheap. I do not think that number is 90 today! 

In fact I think LULULEMON is a far cheaper stock here near 180 than a UPS ever will be! I think LULU has better odds of being a 300 dollar stock than UPS being a 120 dollar stock here in this moment in time. 

Take a look at these January 2027 CALLS of 390 STRIKE. I think they look nice here at 8, may be even better if this was 4 dollars. 

**JMIA**

This is a stock the older timers will recall from the 2020 liquidity driven mania. It is now down 95% from those glories. 

Recently, they have had some analyst upgrades as well as quite rosy outlook presented by the CEO. 

This is 7 and change now, but keep an eye out on this 6 handle. This is also a great type of stock in my opinion for Bull Credit PUT spreads going into year end or so,  if it were to dip a little here. 

I think if we hold a 5-6 on this, this is probably headed to 10. And if we begin capturing some real estate above 10, I think this could be a 15 dollar stock. 

**UNH**

So with UNH, my previous weekly post was construed by some as me being bearish on the stock at 237. If one read the post more attentively, you will note that I was not bearish but I was actually even more bullish with intent to buy more if it dipped into the 200. 

Now where I have been conservative about UNH is that I do not think this trades back to 500-600 anytime soon, I am more conservative to think may be a 50% upside is doable. May be we can even do a 70% if pushed to the limits, The reason I do not think it will go back to old highs atleast in near future is that despite the news of major legends buying this stock, when we were also buying at 250, is that there remain structural headwinds for this stock in near future unless political situation shifts in this country in 2026. 

Despite that, in the intermediate term, I am interested in these January $400 CALLS. If had for 2 dollars. 

**AMD**

If someone with a long term time frame read my post a few months ago back in April when AMD was 95, they will recall I shared a 200 dollar target in AMD. 

This was a longer term target but the markets liked this bullish thesis so much that we are almost here, within a 100 days. 

While AMD could look stretched, I think this consolidation here around 160 is not bad. In fact I think if we hold 150-160, I think we could retest 200 on AMD. 

Now in the short term options, this 200 Dollar call, with November expiry, it is 9 dollars at the moment. Little pricey for me, but if it were 4 bucks, I will be more warmed up to it. 

**eMINI Levels **

As far as the main index goes, you have the FOMC minutes within a few days, and on top of that this is a market that has for most part ignored all the negativity from last few sessions. 

I think this has a lot to do with Trump and Putin summit in Alaska, not necessarily because the markets think peace in Ukraine will be good for mankind, but I think it is mostly because the market reads this as an indirect signal that Trump is still interested in Globalism. 

Remember, the USA is the Global Cop. More nationalist leaders want to dial this back in. They do not want the US to be the Global Cop anymore and part of that is let EU/Ukraine and Russia have at it, and the US does not need to interfere. So, this in my view is a bullish signal that indicates Trump’s mind is still into Globalism and hence stocks are well bid. 

On top of that, I think whatever is said in FOMC can probably safely be ignored as most of it may be priced in. The real deal will be the Jackson hole next week starting on Thursday. This is where Powell meets and hobnobs with the global movers and shakers. This is like Coachella but for the central bankers. Expect Powell to share with his elite pals what he really thinks— about QE and interest rate trajectory. 

**Generally right now I think dips could be supported. **

If we get dip into 6403 on the week, this may be supported for move back into 6500. A daily close below 6403 could lead to a better/deeper dip into 6342. 

Now oftentimes, when we share these ideas like AMD or a PLTR at elevated prices like where they are now, this does not mean that there won’t be better prices available.

 This just means in a given time frame, they appear decent. It is no different than taking a trade in day time frame, going long at 6400, even when knowing that 6250 could be a much better support. Or shorting 6500, knowing that we are in a strong uptrend. The target or objective of all of these trades is different— in other words, the time frames on all of these are quite different. At the same time, you also realize that perhaps PLTR won’t rally a 30X from here at 180. It will probably not be a 15 trillion dollar company. Though I have learned the hard way to never say never. We don’t have a dearth of solid ideas. Large and great winners everywhere you look. It is just that when we get trapped in that “one generational wealth” trade that absolute speaks to us that trouble begins. 

We just gave ULTA that is doubled almost in 3 months. Many such cases. Almost every week.
