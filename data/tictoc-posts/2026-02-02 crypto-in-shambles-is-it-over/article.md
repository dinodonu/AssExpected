# Crypto in shambles. Is it over?

*Daily Plan 2.3.26*
*Tic Toc Trading — Feb 02, 2026*

The primary idea yesterday was to see dips supported and supported they were. 

I think if we now hold 6970, since we have closed above it, I think we should continue to rally into 7050s. 6970 will be key line in sand for me tomorrow. 

I do want to talk about the crypto market in particular the crypto punter psychology is enamored with Bitcoin. Long time readers know this substack is sort of my personal journal where I like to document my ideas and themes over time. One such arena where I have personally made it a goal of 2026 is to learn more about crypto exchanges. 

The big leaders in these are for instance Binance. 

From what I gather the folks who trade at Binance aren’t too happy with it. It is just like your traditional brokers in many aspects even though they call themselves exchanges. 

May be you guys already know all about it, but I am in particular piqued by my interest in what is called a DEX. 

A DEX for those who may not know is a Decentralized exchange. 

I like the idea of it— though I do not know how successful it will be due to political and other interferences in such endeavors by big American companies like Coinbase for instance. 

Whatever the outcome be, I do not mind throwing some change and effort to help understand some of these DEX— I am all for new and interesting tech. If anything, it could motivate me to learn something new and I consider it tuition. 

I am myself learning more about HyperLiquid now. While I do not see myself stay up all night and trade perp futures on Hyperliquid anytime soon (I am more of a futures guy in cash session), I like this token called HYPE. 

Check it out and lemme know what y’all think. I like the action in it, it is about 33 now, with decent daily volume. I bought some and I may add some more if it dipped into low 20s.. Just gonna park it and hold it and see where it goes next 1-2 years.
