# Weekly Plan 2.15.26

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Feb 15, 2026*

With most big tech earnings now behind us, relative underperformance in the big tech stocks, as well as this current situation of chop in the main indices, like SPY, and QQQ, what we need is some sort of catalyst here to launch higher. 

This could be announcement of some sort of fiscal stimulus, or another round of massive QE by the FED. 

At the FED, the situation itself is muddier than earlier thought— Warsh himself is not as dovish as everyone will like him to be. Then you have a potential of Powell remaining in office, as a Governor until 2028. 

From a Warsh perspective, he will very much want Powell to stay on as Powell helps Warsh be an anchor to protect against late night phone calls from Trump, demanding rate cuts. He can always say “Look, I want to do some QE but this Powell guy will not go along with it”. 

Now I have no doubt that Warsh will deliver on rate cuts this year. I think he will be all for atleast 3 rate cuts in 2026 but make no mistake that at his core, Warsh is an “Inflation Hawk” and he fundamentally distrusts the scope and depth of FED’s role in market functioning and plumbing. 

Not so long ago, this is what he had to say about FED doing QE and expanding its balance sheet: 

“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope, encroaching further on other macroeconomic domains. More debt is accumulated, more capital is misallocated, more institutional lines are crossed, risks of future shocks are magnified and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.”

I will let you ponder over if this is the guy who will further expand or curtail FED’s ever increasing balance sheet. 

If he has his way, once confirmed, I think he will be more hawkish than what Trump wants him to be, and I think for the first time in decades we may have a FED Chair who does things a bit differently — whether it is how much the FED cares about stock prices or how the FED disseminates its messaging. He will be more of a Greenspan than a Yellen or a Powell. 

Politically, the President’s polling numbers are abhorrent. If this trend does not reverse, you are looking at a generational win for the democrats in midterms, and potentially in 2028. 

Knowing Trump, he does have a remarkable capability to turn the public opinion around, so I will not rule him out yet— however, he will have to morph into a more of a Centrist as well as unleash some sort of stimulus for the average Americans to help stop the bleeding in poll numbers. In short, the growth has to pick up, he has to back down from some of the extremely unpopular policies. 

This is where we are in mid of the February of 2026 from a 30K feet. 

Now technically, if you are looking for some respite from the choppiness and selling pressure, I will reiterate my view from couple of days ago—this whole zone right above us at 6930 to 6950 is extremely important and as such can be used as potential resistance on the weekly time frames. 

While I would argue that some of the stocks in Nasdaq, like AMZN and NFLX are indeed priced on the fair side, I think even a GOOG at 300 is attractive (technically), the market as a whole remains extremely overvalued. 

A lot of these stocks are just selling off as the market cannot digest the CAPEX spend. But then in some of these instances, like GOOG, these are cash rich companies and have to float 100 year bonds to raise money to do some more CAPEX. What does this tell you about being able to raise capital in 2026? It looks like they may be having some hardships. If these cash cow giants are struggling, what about smaller firms? In past, raising capital on 0% was easy. Not so much so now. 

Valuations do not matter until they matter— if the FED and the Congress decide to print some more trillions, we can break out of here to new highs. Without concrete spending action, I think we could continue to break lower or at the very least keep balancing like we have been for several months now. 

What neither me nor anyone else knows is what is the likelihood of a major stimulus? 

The stocks still remain near all time highs. The bond yields have remained stubbornly high. The wages have grown and unemployment is low, albeit you can argue a lot of this is due to the immigrants fleeing the job scene and the US seeing a net decrease in migrant population for the first time in over 5 decades. 

**Weekly emini levels **

> **Scenario 1:** If we retest 6930-6950, and hold it, this could be the weekly resistance for a move down into 6880.

> **Scenario 2: **Friday low at 6810, if tested could be an intermediate support level. My weekly edge case will be either a break of 6810 on the downside which would indicate a downward trend formation, or a market that goes above 6880 and then remains above 6880— which would indicate more balancing in days and weeks ahead. We last traded 6840 at time of this post.

**To summarize:** yes, we have been quite weak of late but the trend is not really clear here. It could become clearer if we remain here below 6930, if we began closing below 6810, but until then, if I am a bear, I would not get hopes too high and we could see more balancing here before next wave is confirmed. We need some sort of confirmation and I think that’s lacking in this tape at the moment. 

With short term options, the way I am thinking of these is that these are probably headed to 0. At the same time, there is some degree of edge present, due to technicals or market structure,  which makes the option a good risk to reward even though it is most likely headed to 0. These are classic trades not investments. 

What do I mean by this? 

Take the weekly expiry MSTR 136 CALL which is right now priced at $4. For this call to be even breakeven, MSTR needs to close above $140 in next 4 days. Will I pay 4 bucks for this call, even if MSTR action looked bullish last week? 

No because for me due to tightness of the expiry date, I do not see an edge in this call at 4 dollars. 

Now, if early on in the week, may be Tuesday or so, if MSTR were to pullback into 126-128 and this call was $1.5 or $2, I can see my edge go significantly up. By risking 1.5 dollars, I can see there is a higher chance of this call going back to 3 or even $4— even if MSTR were to expire below 140, this call would probably have had some decent action during the week. I do not need to sit thru the expiry to realize atleast some profit in this call if I purchased it at a more fair price. 

This is how I view each and every option trade. Often this means there has to be the tight play between IV, premiums and greeks for an option trade to come about. 

Similar example with SMCI for the weekly 32 CALL. This is a 50 cent call at the moment. With bearish general market, this call is more likely to expire at 0 than $1. But if it were had at 20-30 cents, can this call between now and Friday trade into 50-60 cents again? Is 25 cents paid to find out if the call can trade back up into 50 cents a good risk to reward trade? 

What about monthly March 35 CALL for SMCI if had at 2 bucks? You get the gist. 

These are some of the questions I ask about any of these options I am interested in, especially the ones with very short duration to expiry. 

**PCG**

Take a look at this PCG stock. 

This is a very old orderflow stock which I had shared my months ago before it almost doubled. 

I think it looks nice here at 18 to push into 21-22 if we hold 15. 

**TSLA**

Tesla I thought had a good week, and again unless we see outright bear breakdowns in general market here below 6800, I think TSLA could be supported here. I would not be too bearish on TSLA, unless it went below 390-400. It is around 410 now. 

I think there could be may be a 10-15% move on upside, if we hold 390 on TSLA.
