# Nearing Lows.

*Daily Plan 11.7.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 07, 2025*

Hey folks— 

So from our chat update yesterday, we saw a nice sell off into 6750s today.

If we see another day or so of balancing here, per my weekly post, I think we have seen the swing time frame lows here. 

For the session tomorrow, if we can hold 6703 or so, I think we can retrace back to 6821 in next couple of sessions. 6821 remains important resistance in my view, unless we begin to see a couple of daily closes above it. 

We last traded 6742 at time of this post. These are emini S&P500 levels. 

To recap— I think **6703**, if holds could be an important support for a move back into **6821**. **If **we see a Daily close or two now above 6820, this is a good sign for the bulls and could mean we have seen swing lows here near 6700. 

I will cover this in more detail, but as many of you have been aware, I have been not too keen on a lot of stocks at these levels, in last several weeks now, and results are clear in hindsight why I was not feeling it. Despite stellar earnings, we have seen these stocks not able to make much dent indicating orderflow weakness in these names. 

Hopefully a lot of setups should now clear up between now and year end which I will be sharing in my weekly post. Stay tuned!
