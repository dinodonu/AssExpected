# Weekly Plan 2.9.26

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Feb 08, 2026*

Hey folks—  

One school of traders thinks that the late Thursday rally in the S&P500 index, all the way from those lows set near 64740, to close some 15 hours later and 200 points higher at 6950 could have been due to a “Bear Market Rally”, which tend to be quite vicious in their speed and amplitude. 

This presupposes that we are in a bear market at the moment. 

I agree that these Bear Market rallies can be vicious, where I have a different set of view is that I do not see a confirmed Bear Market yet. This is something I have said for several months now— I do not think we are in a structural bear market at the moment, so I have my reservations on how much I read into this Friday action. 

Within the related markets, if you read my post from Thursday night, Bitcoin also rallied very nicely from that support level I shared in my Daily Post. At one point, the crypto coin was up about $9000 from this support level. 

I think further gains in Bitcoin are possible here but there are a couple of assumptions I first want to share. 

I want to assume that there is a large segment of influential and wealthy individuals who believe that Bitcoin is an important asset and they see this dip as attractive. Furthermore, let us assume that Bitcoin truly is a decentralized asset with no one able to control its fundamental features — which is essentially a peer to peer network. However, this decentralized tenet of Bitcoin has been hijacked, or rather diluted by mushrooming of all sort of treasury holdings and ETFS. 

If you agree with me on these assumptions, then the bearish case for Bitcoin also arises from these same assumptions— for a truly decentralized asset, which was meant to unshackle you from the “TradFi institutional” grips, Bitcoin today is perhaps more concentrated in fewer hands than any other comparable asset. 

So for instance, by some estimates, the US financial institutions alone own about 20% of entire supply of Bitcoin. 

Then you have these Treasury Company players like Saylor who also own a significant chunk of Bitcoins. These kind of concentrations make the crypto coin a prime target for market price manipulations. It is one thing when there are no ETFS, no JP Morgans, no strategies meddling with Bitcoin. It is entirely another thing when you have potentially trillions of dollars of derivatives of Bitcoin trading on public exchanges— this can and does create outsized volatility. 

These Wall Street institutions can see everyone’s orderflow and often can and do front run it— they do not have the conviction of a Bitcoin Maxi HODLER guy holding a quarter of a bitcoin. The banks do not believe in changing the world, they just want to make a buck from the existing world, so they will dump bitcoins if they think the price can drop further. They even dump bitcoins to lower its price so they can scoop up more of it at bargain prices. 

Now at this moment at 69-70K Bitcoin, I think you have the US Government potentially providing bids and this is why I think it has rallied sharply from 61K. 

I think we could retrace all the way back to 84-85K and then see the tone of the market once there. Right now what I said on Thursday is still valid— I see support all the way to 37K. 

**Emini levels **

On the emini side, if you are in the camp that thinks this is was a classic bear market rally, what you want to see here is a quick rejection of these prices here at 6940 and you want to see us begin to settle down right below 6900 or so early on in the week. 

If we do not see a clean rejection here I think this market could have enough firepower to test the other end of the range now at 7050. 

**Few levels of interest— **

> Scenario 1: I will like to see 6860 if tested for a move back into 6925-6930. This could lead to more balancing here and an eventual push to retest 7050s.

> Scenario 2: If you are in the bearish camp here, you would want to see 6860 level break and we remain under it for most of the week ahead.

Outside of this, there really is not much going on at the moment. Long time readers know all about what I say “Asymmetry” in the markets— an asymmetric market is where there is the most potential with least risk. This is often a phase of a market which can be described as accumulation phase. In this phase, the masses do not yet know about the market while larger traders are loading up. Once they have their full line, the move starts. 

So for instance, INTEL at 20 bucks. At 20 bucks, your most risk is may be a 20 points. With a potential to make 20-40 bucks. Even more. 

However, as the price increases in  , the degree of asymmetry decreases. When some one is buying a stock in an uptrend, at the highs, they could still very well make profit on it, but they are buying it on less and less asymmetry. Be rest assured that the most asymmetric ideas are not even yet born, they are being formed right now and orderflow often will be first to uncover and share them here in this Substack. 

**GLD**

Pursuant to what I just said, Gold at 5000 is not what it was at 1600 when I first shared it here. At 1600 a lot of asymmetry existed. 

Now this automatically does not mean that I will not any Gold just because it is now trading 5000. 

As a matter of fact, I think Gold is headed higher into 6500-7000. 

In GLD, a decent line in sand could be 410-415 for a push back into 500s. 

In short term, I think Hecla, which I first gave here at 5 bucks and is now trading 21 can be a decent set up but I think 17-19 must hold for another push into 30. 

**Tech **

On the tech side, if you are in the camp that thinks the stocks are headed higher from here, I think both ORCL and NFLX look decent risk to reward here at 140 and 80 bucks respectively. 

May be we see another 10% move to downside, but I think we have sold down quite aggressively in these and these could retrace into 180 and 110 respectively. 

**NVDA**

As pure lotto, this March 6th $210 CALL which is now around 2 bucks looks nice. If there is some selling next week, may be it can be had near 1 to 1.5 but that depends on if we see the general index soften into next week. 

**AMD**

I like the bounce. I think if we hold 180, we could retrace to 240-250. It is 200 or so now. 

**WULF**

On crypto side, I like this relative strength in WULF. I think these January 2027, $25 CALLS looks nice here at 2 bucks and change. 

**PFE**

I recently gave a call on PFE that has doubled. 

This is a slow mover stock. Not much going on at the moment. I do think the low may be in on PFE but in short term, March 6th, $27 PUT if had for like 20 cents just as a quick lotto.
