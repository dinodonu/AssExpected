# AI Rally Alive and Well.

*Daily Plan 11.5.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Nov 05, 2025*

Good morning traders- 

We are almost at mid of the week and the entire week has been perched between my two levels, shared last Sunday morning! Please see below. 

Our folks get these levels regularly and they are usually on right side of the tape.

You can now see the high probability potential of our orderflow levels, shared with our folks almost every day. 

Levels for today 

We can lean on some of the overnight lows near 6750-6756. 

We are now 6790. 

These are emini levels. Please adjust for SPX. 

> Scenario 1: I am seeing support kick in if 6756 holds for a retest of 6800.

> Scenario 2: Bears need 6756 gone for more sell off, even so the sell off could be supported at 6700 for the session.

For a healthy auction, I would like to see some more balancing here. If we see more balancing here above 6700, we could make another swipe at 6900. What I do not want to see is a market in a rush to get to 6900, in which case I think rallies may be sold. 

**AMZN**

Keep an eye out on this AMAZON at 230 area. Stock I think if it holds this breakout range is headed higher into 300 dollar range. It is now 247. I personally think AI fever now should jump ship from all things chips and what not, to AI implementers. These are your AMZN, TSLA etc. This is why I am hesitant to call an end to this market rally yet. I think we still could have some more juice here.
