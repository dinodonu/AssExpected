# Daily Plan 9.10.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 10, 2025*

Hey- 

So some fairly impressive winners from our recent stocks, whether that be GOOG, BABA, UNH MU or GLW, and many more. 

On the emini side, this weekly support level at 6440 remains very important as support if tested.  

Interim, 6507 or so remains a major level unless broken. 

> **Scenario 1:** If we hold 6507 as support, I think we are headed higher into 6550.
