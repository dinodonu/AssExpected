# Daily Plan 8.13.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 13, 2025*

Hey-

So the markets continue to favor most of our recent stocks. Many such cases, whether that is TSLA that traded almost into 340 today, UNH which closed back above 262 on the day, COIN, SOFI, Ethereum crossed back above 4500 today, give at 3500 only weeks ago. These are to name but only a handful out of dozens of names. 

Please see archives for more. 

What has not panned out for us is the DJT bullish idea. It has not gone anywhere. 

I think it kind of looks very interesting here at these levels. I really do not get it why it won’t go up. 

At any rate, I personally think these January 20 CALLS at $1 and change at the moment, I think they look nice from a risk to reward point of view. 

In the general index, another great day for my levels. We saw some resistance at week levels but got bid right back up! We are now 6460. 

Minus any major news tomorrow, we could balance here. I think 6500 could be in cross hairs if we hold 6440 or so. 

> Scenario 1: If we test and hold 6440 or so we could remain balanced for a move back to 6463.

> Scenario 2: If we open and remain here above 6460, we could set sights on 6500. Bears will now need to close below 6440 on Daily time frame, I think to test lower levels.
