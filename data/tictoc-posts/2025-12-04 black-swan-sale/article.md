# Black Swan Sale

*Daily Plan 12.4.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Dec 04, 2025*

Our folks continue to enjoy the fruits of very actionable insights— whether it is the emini levels, COHR, RGTI, TSLA, ORCL, UNH , PLTR, HECLA, SLV, AAPL, NOK, GME or any of the other several names. These are all massive winners in last 1-2 months alone! 

On the emini side the line of least resistance still appears up. 

I know my intermediate level that was shared on Sunday, has been the low of the sessions now which I lost count of, but what Ideally I want to see is a liquidity release and trade down into 6750 for a push higher into 6903. 

What you have is a proliferation of furus who claim to foretell a massive sell off, some sort of black swan event, that will bring untold riches for their followers. 

In reality, there are no such guaranteed outcomes. Yes it may come but purely chance.  Remember, the longer your time horizon, or the bigger your target, especially on the short side, the more heat you will take on your trade, and less will be your win rate. 

In fact, statistically the odds of these so called black swan sell offs, where there is a 40-50% drawdown is less than a percent, perhaps even lower since 2010s. This is a very long term average. Going back 100 years or more. 

You want to be more hands on and use the odds in your favor rather than harbor mathematical fantasies and fight statistical odds. What these so called furus share, these are not actionable insights. Even if they are right over long term , average person will be stopped out or give up. What we share day in and day out is actionable, it is profitable— emini levels, swing ideas, long term stocks, short term options and lottos. 

How many of these furu calls have panned out? They become bearish on TSLA at 390, our orderflow support, and stock pops 60 points in 4 days. 

They become bearish on NVDA at 180 and Jensen goes to White House asking for export curbs to be removed. What happens to NVDA if export curbs are removed via a 2 AM tweet? What does it do to S&P500? You get the gist. 

Anyways, I digress. 

While the line of least resistance remains up, it is not a bad idea to want to have a 2-3% sell off. 

For the session tomorrow, on emini we can lean on 6847-6858. 

> **Scenario 1: **If we are able to break this level and remain below it, we may target 6820.

> **Scenario 2:** My edge case on the session tomorrow will be above 6880 (with support possible at 6847) which could be bullish continuation into 6903 and on downside, if we remain below 6820 (with resistance potential at 6830) , this may target 6798.

On an admin side note, several folks have asked me for a holiday sale as I almost never do this and in fact the publication price only goes up over time. Everyone else does it but that is because they know their average sub will be bagged in 2-3 months. My goal is to have a serious and committed group of traders who I want to succeed  and be profitable longer term. Use the offer below to get a one time sale, one of the largest in publication history. Help me spread the message of the active trading, hands on professional tape reading by sharing the publication. 

**HOOD**

If you recall, this stock was shared by me when it was 3 dollars. 

Today it is trading 130 dollars and I think the set up looks nice for a move higher into 160. 

I think a pullback here into 115-120 is not a bad thing and could be supported for a move higher into 139 followed by 160s.
