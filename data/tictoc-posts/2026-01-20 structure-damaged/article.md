# Structure damaged. 

*Daily Plan 1.21.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 20, 2026*

While I think the market is overtly emotional at the moment, there is a damage of structure right above us which needs to be repaired. 

**Specifically**, we will need to do some work repairing the damage above 6870 which could look like a day or two of closes above 6870 followed by 6900. 

Minus this, I will favor a little deeper sell off. 

For the session itself, I think 6750 or so needs to hold. 

> Scenario 1: As long as we remain below **6870**, I think pressure could remain elevated to make a run into **6819**.

> Scenario 2: A break of **6819** without much trading above 6819 could expose 6750.

These are emini levels , for $SPX subtract about 30. 

Outside of day to day, I think as we approach 6700 these are some good prints which could help names like NFLX and AAPL get their Mojo back.
