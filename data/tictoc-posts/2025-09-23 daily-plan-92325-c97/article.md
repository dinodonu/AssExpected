# Daily Plan 9.23.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 23, 2025*

Hey traders- 

On the session tomorrow keep an eye out on this 6709-6714 area. 

If tested, this may be supported for a move up into 6734. 

On SPY 0DTE, these 664 CALLS if had as lotto under 40-50 cents could be worth a look, in case we do not start breaking below 6700 on the main emini index. 

Similarly, if the 667 PUT had for like 20-30 cents could be a quick lotto trade if tested. 

Remember in 0DTE, most of the trading in these type of options is scalping type, usually traders use these to capture quick moves rather than hold them thru expiry. 

On longer time frames what we have is a very unusual market action. I think this is a market front running the FED rate cuts and while someone shorting could get lucky, what we need is some sort of confirmation in price action to find decent risk to reward shorts. I mentioned this in an earlier post, it is possible that once a solid downtrend begins, we will most likely lose out top 10% of the move but it is worth it for confirmation rather than gambling on impulse.
