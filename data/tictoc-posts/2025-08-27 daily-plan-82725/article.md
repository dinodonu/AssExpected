# Daily Plan 8.27.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 27, 2025*

Hey traders- 

Between the cash session open on Monday and then cash session open on Tuesday, we did a nice round trip on emini S&P500, first falling off from the weekly resistance near 6500 and then finding support at the intermediate weekly support level to close the session yesterday near 6480. 

Yesterday’s auction in several ways was a mirror image of Monday’s . 

1. Pre NVDA, I will be interested in the 6456-6460 area. These are emini levels.
2. If tested, this could offer support for a move back into recent highs near 6480.
3. 6475 or so is also an important level for the cash session initial opening range (first hour trade), if this holds we could retest 6486 or so.
