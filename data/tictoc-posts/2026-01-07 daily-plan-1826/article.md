# Daily Plan 1.8.26

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Jan 07, 2026*

Hey traders- 

Little bit of mixed session with strong first half with low near 6970 which traded up into 7000s, missed 7015 by about 7 dollars. Weaker finish to the session with a close right above 6956. 

On the lows we do not have much liquidity really at these levels, which often indicates lack of “interest”. 

I did not like this rejection at 7000 which I think needs to be repaired in the session tomorrow. 

1. We can lean on 6990-7000 as potential resistance for another push lower into 6950 or so.
2. If we give up 6940-6950, there could be volatility and we could see next leg of support at 6910-6922.

Now this 7015 is an old contract high. So I am not surprised at some level of weakness here. What is far more important in my view is that we continue to hold this line here at 6940is.
