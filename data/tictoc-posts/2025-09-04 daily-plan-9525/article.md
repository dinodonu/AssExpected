# Daily Plan 9.5.25

**
*Tic Toc Trading — Sep 04, 2025*

So with the NFP  news tomorrow, I am hoping to get some sort of resolution here out of this range which has held for quite a few weeks now. 

If we get a clean breakout here, I think this whole 6500 or so area could become a longer term support, but at the same time, you have this established resistance here at 6500 which is hard to ignore. 

I reckon if we are going to break out of this rut, we need a couple of daily closes here above 6500. 

I think we can probably lean on this 6530 or so level for the session tomorrow on the upside. 

I do not like to do a super formal plan on days like CPI, NFP etc as market can get in price discovery mode and levels may be trounced around due to lack of liquidity. However, here are few thoughts: 

1. If we get a favorable jobs report, this could be strong job growth with abating wage pressures, I think could be a positive catalyst.
2. If we are going to open above 6530 or so, I will expect support during the intraday session to come in near 6522-6530, if tested.
3. At the same time, this 6530 has been a well established resistance. At the very least, if a breakout does not materialize, we could lean on some of these levels near 6403-6414 as potential support, if tested.
4. With strength in AAPL and GOOG, as described in the weekly version, I am not sure we can get a lot of takers below 6414, if offered minus a meaningful crack in AAPL.

This is sort of a market which is personally hard for me to read at the moment, outside of day to day time frames. You have several conflicting signals. In such instances in past, I will let the price action resolve on its own and then allow for me to establish better support and resistances. 

Good set ups will come along, there is really no lack of those. In fact some of these names shared earlier by me are looking robust now. OPEN is now almost 6, up 300% from that $2. GLW, COMM, MU, APH, PRM, HIMS and then dozens more. 

Take a long term approach folks. Results will come. They have to.
