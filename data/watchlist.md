## Key Themes from Tic Toc (Aug 2025 - Feb 2026)

- **Gold/Silver**: Ultra-bullish on gold ($5100 → $8000-10000 by 2028). Silver bullish but more speculative. Fair value floor for gold at $3500.
- **AI Infrastructure Broadening**: 2026 = year of AI software/application, not just chips. Power & materials stocks benefit.
- **Anti-AI Hedges**: BA, HDB, traditional industrials that AI helps rather than disrupts.
- **Copper/Materials**: Bullish on copper miners (SCCO, COPX) and materials (VAW, APD, LIN, ETN) for AI data center power demand.
- **Crypto**: Long-term bearish on Bitcoin. Treasury companies (MSTR) going to zero in bear market. Would buy BTC at $10-30K.
- **Tariffs**: "TACO" pattern (Trump Always Chickens Out). Tariffs not going away but market adapts.
- **Buy Dips, Don't Chase**: Core philosophy. Wait for stocks to come to your levels. Split orders into multiple lots.
