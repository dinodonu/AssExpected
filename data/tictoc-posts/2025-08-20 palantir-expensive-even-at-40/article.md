# Palantir expensive even at $40? 

*Daily Plan 8.20.25*
*Tic Toc Trading — Aug 20, 2025*

Hey traders-

Emini S&P500 remained under pressure throughout the session, having carved out a high at that 6510 orderflow resistance  from last week and upon break of support at 6460 today, we saw a nice move down which I thought smacked of lack of demand throughout the session. 

What you have is this market interacting here near the Weekly orderflow level at 6400 and I think this area remains super important going into the session tomorrow. 

I do think this whole zone here at 6380-6403 remains very important. These are September emini levels, for SPX subtract about 15 or so. 

I am not a fan of these type of moves that come out of nowhere without a warning and hence I need to see this market retake 6460 on the upside. 

With this said, we can lean on this 6460 support break level tomorrow. 

> Scenario 1: I think if we test and hold 6460 area, this could prove resistance for a move down to the session lows today near 6419.

> Scenario 2: Of-course the weekly support remains a support until broken, and if we were to open below 6403 in the session tomorrow, I will like it to fill some gaps first order of the business. So in other words if we do open here at or below 6403, I will like to see atleast some support at 6380-6400.

What you also potentially have as an interesting development is this gap itself in VIX. If I am a buyer here, at the very least I need to see a clear rejection of 6380 if traded on the downside, and as a plus I want to see this market retake 6460. 

Going ahead a session or two, you have the Jackson Hole and the FOMC up next, if this market refuses to hold 6380-6403, 6250s could be fair game which I think is a relatively more robust support for swing time frame setups. 

PLTR

In related markets, we saw quite a stunning reversal in PLTR. This was egged on by Short seller Citron doubling down on their PLTR short position calling it being expensive even at $40! 

This number was arrived after they compared Palantir’s current valuation to OpenAI’s estimated $500 billion valuation, suggesting that if Palantir traded at the same forward price to sales multiple of 1700,  its implied fair value would be around $40 per share, which would still be expensive. 

Now while I do not argue with the valuation concerns, and I think it has some merits, I will question if the low prices will stock around here in this cycle, if the general market remains supported. 

I myself expected these gaps to fill at 160 and the stock after hours is trading another 3% below the Cash close, in part helped by softness in Nasdaq. 

While I have been eyeing some September calls on PLTR, even at 4-5 bucks I think they remain a bit expensive. Now if we see the general market find a firmer footing, and I think the PLTR momentum needs to run its course too, which I think could be closer to 136-140. If so, I may consider and share some September calls if had around a dollar or two as lottos. 

This is why we have a shopping list for these sell offs, now a day or two does not tell the whole story, this whole saga may play out over several days to weeks. Stay tuned for more.
